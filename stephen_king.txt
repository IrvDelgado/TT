<p> 10 Terrific Facts About Stephen King </p>
<p> As if being one of the world's most successful and prolific writers wasn't already reason enough to celebrate, Stephen King is ringing in his birthday as the toast of Hollywood. As It continues to break box office records, we're digging into the horror master's past. Here are 10 things you might not have known about Stephen King, who turns 70 years old today. </p>
<p> 1. STEPHEN KING AND HIS WIFE, TABITHA, OWN A RADIO STATION. </p>
<p> Stephen and Tabitha King own Zone Radio, a company that serves to head their three radio stations in Maine. One of them, WKIT, is a classic rock station that goes by the tagline "Stephen King's Rock Station." </p>
<p> 2. HE'S A HARDCORE RED SOX FAN. </p>

<p> Not only did he write a story about the Boston Red Sox—The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon (who was a former Red Sox pitcher)—he also had a cameo in the Jimmy Fallon/Drew Barrymore movie Fever Pitch, which is about a crazed Sox fan. He plays himself and throws out the first pitch at a game. </p>
<p> 3. HE WAS HIT BY A CAR, THEN BOUGHT THE CAR THAT HIT HIM. </p>
<p> You probably remember that King was hit by a van not far from his summer home in Maine in 1999. The incident left King with a collapsed lung, multiple fractures to his hip and leg, and a gash to the head. Afterward, King and his lawyer bought the van for $1500 with King announcing that, "Yes, we've got the van, and I'm going to take a sledgehammer and beat it!" </p>
<p> 4. AS A KID, HIS FRIEND WAS STRUCK AND KILLED BY A TRAIN. </p>
<p> King's brain seems to be able to create chilling stories at such an amazing clip, yet he's seen his fair share of horror in real life. In addition to the aforementioned car accident, when King was just a kid his friend was struck and killed by a train (a plot line that made it into his story "The Body," which was adapted into Stand By Me). While it would be easy to assume that this incident informed much of King's writing, the author claims to have no memory of the event: </p>
<p> "According to Mom, I had gone off to play at a neighbor’s house—a house that was near a railroad line. About an hour after I left I came back (she said), as white as a ghost. I would not speak for the rest of the day; I would not tell her why I’d not waited to be picked up or phoned that I wanted to come home; I would not tell her why my chum’s mom hadn’t walked me back but had allowed me to come alone. </p>
<p> "It turned out that the kid I had been playing with had been run over by a freight train while playing on or crossing the tracks (years later, my mother told me they had picked up the pieces in a wicker basket). My mom never knew if I had been near him when it happened, if it had occurred before I even arrived, or if I had wandered away after it happened. Perhaps she had her own ideas on the subject. But as I’ve said, I have no memory of the incident at all; only of having been told about it some years after the fact." </p>
<p> 5. HE WROTE A MUSICAL WITH JOHN MELLENCAMP. </p>

<p> King, John Mellencamp, and T Bone Burnett collaborated on a musical, Ghost Brothers of Darkland County, which made its debut in 2012. The story is based on a house that Mellencamp bought in Indiana that came complete with a ghost story. Legend has it that three siblings were messing around in the woods and one of the brothers accidentally got shot. The surviving brother and sister jumped in the car to go get help, and in their panic, swerved off the road right into a tree and were killed instantly. Of course, the three now haunt the woods by Mellencamp's house. </p>
<p> 6. HE PLAYED IN A BAND WITH OTHER SUCCESSFUL AUTHORS. </p>
<p> King played rhythm guitar for a band made up of successful writers called The Rock Bottom Remainders. From 1992 to 2012, the band "toured" about once a year. In addition to King, Amy Tan, Dave Barry, Mitch Albom, Barbara Kingsolver, Matt Groening and Ridley Pearson were just some of its other members. </p>
<p> 7. HE'S A NATIVE MAINER. </p>
<p> King writes about Maine a lot because he knows and loves The Pine Tree State: he was born there, grew up there, and still lives there (in Bangor). Castle Rock, Derry, and Jerusalem's Lot—the fictional towns he has written about in his books—are just products of King's imagination, but he can tell you exactly where in the state they would be if they were real. </p>
<p> 8. HE HAS BATTLED DRUG AND ALCOHOL PROBLEMS. </p>
<p> Throughout much of the 1980s, King struggled with drug and alcohol abuse. In discussing this time, he admitted that, "There's one novel, Cujo, that I barely remember writing at all. I don't say that with pride or shame, only with a vague sense of sorrow and loss. I like that book. I wish I could remember enjoying the good parts as I put them down on the page." </p>
<p> It came to a head when his family members staged an intervention and confronted him with drug paraphernalia they had collected from his trash can. It was the eye-opener King needed; he got help and has been sober ever since. </p>
<p> 9. THERE WAS A RUMOR THAT HE WROTE A LOST TIE-IN NOVEL. </p>
<p> King was an avid Lost fan and sometimes wrote about the show in his Entertainment Weekly column, "The Pop of King." The admiration was mutual. Lost's writers mentioned that King was a major influence in their work. There was a lot of speculation that he was the man behind Bad Twin, a Lost tie-in mystery, but he debunked that rumor. </p>
<p> 10. HE IS SURROUNDED BY WRITERS. </p>

<p> Stephen isn't the only writer in the King family: His wife, Tabitha King, has published several novels. Joe, their oldest son, followed in his dad's footsteps and is a bestselling horror writer (he writes under the pen name Joe Hill). Youngest child Owen has written a collection of short stories and one novella and he and his dad co-wrote Sleeping Beauties, which will be released later this month (Owen also married a writer). Naomi, the only King daughter, is a minister and gay activist. </p>
<p> 10 Little Facts About Louisa May Alcott </p>
<p> Born on November 29, 1832, Louisa May Alcott led a fascinating life. Besides enchanting millions of readers with her novel Little Women, she worked as a Civil War nurse, fought against slavery, and registered women to vote. Here are 10 facts about the celebrated author. </p>
<p> 1. Louisa May Alcott had many famous friends. </p>
<p> Louisa's parents, Bronson and Abigail Alcott, raised their four daughters in a politically active household in Massachusetts. As a child, Alcott briefly lived with her family in a failed Transcendentalist commune, helped her parents hide slaves who had escaped via the Underground Railroad, and had discussions about women’s rights with Margaret Fuller. </p>
<p> Throughout her life, she socialized with her father’s friends, including Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Although her family was always poor, Alcott had access to valuable learning experiences. She read books in Emerson’s library and learned about botany at Walden Pond with Thoreau, later writing a poem called "Thoreau’s Flute" for her friend. She also socialized with abolitionist Frederick Douglass and women’s suffrage activist Julia Ward Howe. </p>
<p> 2. Her first nom de plume was Flora Fairfield. </p>
<p> As a teenager, Alcott worked a variety of teaching and servant jobs to earn money for her family. She first became a published writer at 19 years old, when a women’s magazine printed one of her poems. For reasons that are unclear, Alcott used a pen name—Flora Fairfield—rather than her real name, perhaps because she felt that she was still developing as a writer. But in 1854 at age 22, Alcott used her own name for the first time. She published Flower Fables, a collection of fairy tales she had written six years earlier for Emerson’s daughter, Ellen. </p>
<p> 3. She secretly wrote pulp fiction. </p>
<p> Before writing Little Women, Alcott wrote Gothic pulp fiction under the nom de plume A.M. Barnard. Continuing her amusing penchant for alliteration, she wrote books and plays called Perilous Play and Pauline’s Passion and Punishment to make easy money. These sensational, melodramatic works are strikingly different than the more wholesome, righteous vibe she captured in Little Women, and she didn’t advertise her former writing as her own after Little Women became popular. </p>
<p> 4. She wrote about her experience as a Civil War nurse. </p>
<p> In 1861, at the beginning of the U.S. Civil War, Alcott sewed Union uniforms in Concord and, the next year, enlisted as an army nurse. In a Washington, D.C. hotel-turned-hospital, she comforted dying soldiers and helped doctors perform amputations. During this time, she wrote about her experiences in her journal and in letters to her family. In 1863, she published Hospital Sketches, a fictionalized account, based on her letters, of her stressful yet meaningful experiences as a wartime nurse. The book became massively popular and was reprinted in 1869 with more material. </p>
<p> 5. She suffered from mercury poisoning. </p>
<p> After a month and a half of nursing in D.C., Alcott caught typhoid fever and pneumonia. She received the standard treatment at the time—a toxic mercury compound called calomel. (Calomel was used in medicines through the 19th century.) Because of this exposure to mercury, Alcott suffered from symptoms of mercury poisoning for the rest of her life. She had a weakened immune system, vertigo, and had episodes of hallucinations. To combat the pain caused by the mercury poisoning (as well as a possible autoimmune disorder, such as lupus, that could have been triggered by it), she took opium. Alcott died of a stroke in 1888, at 55 years old. </p>
<p> 6. She wrote Little Women to help her father. </p>
<p> In 1867, Thomas Niles, an editor at a publishing house, asked Alcott if she wanted to write a novel for girls. Although she tried to get excited about the project, she thought she wouldn’t have much to write about girls because she was a tomboy. The next year, Alcott’s father was trying to convince Niles to publish his manuscript about philosophy. He told Niles that his daughter could write a book of fairy stories, but Niles still wanted a novel about girls. Niles told Alcott’s father that if he could get his daughter to write a (non-fairy) novel for girls, he would publish his philosophy manuscript. So to make her father happy and help his writing career, Alcott wrote about her adolescence growing up with her three sisters. Published in September 1868, the first part of Little Women was a huge success. The second part was published in 1869, and Alcott went on to write sequels such as Little Men (1871) and Jo’s Boys (1886). </p>
<p> 7. She was an early suffragette. </p>
<p> In the 1870s, Alcott wrote for a women’s rights periodical and went door-to-door in Massachusetts to encourage women to vote. In 1879, the state passed a law that would allow women to vote in local elections on anything involving education and children—Alcott registered immediately, becoming the first woman registered in Concord to vote. Although met with resistance, she, along with 19 other women, cast ballots in an 1880 town meeting. The Nineteenth Amendment was finally ratified in 1920, decades after Alcott died. </p>
<p> 8. She pretended to be her own servant to trick her fans. </p>
<p> After the success of Little Women, fans who connected with the book traveled to Concord to see where Alcott grew up. One month, Alcott had a hundred strangers knock on the door of Orchard House, her family’s home, hoping to see her. Because she didn’t like the attention, she sometimes pretended to be a servant when she answered the front door, hoping to trick fans into leaving. </p>
<p> 9. ALCOTT NEVER HAD CHILDREN, BUT SHE CARED FOR HER NIECE. </p>
<p> Although Alcott never married or had biological children, she took care of her orphaned niece. In 1879, Alcott’s youngest sister May died a month after giving birth to her daughter. As she was dying, May told her husband to send the baby, whom she had named Louisa in honor of Alcott, to her older sister. Nicknamed Lulu, the girl spent her childhood with Alcott, who wrote her stories and seemed a good fit for her high-spiritedness. Lulu was just 8 when Alcott died, at which point she went to live with her father in Switzerland. </p>
<p> 10. FANS CAN VISIT ALCOTT'S FAMILY HOME IN CONCORD, MASSACHUSETTS. </p>
<p> At 399 Lexington Road in Concord, Massachusetts, tourists can visit Orchard House, the Alcott family home from 1858 to 1877. Orchard House is a designated National Historic Landmark, and visitors can take a guided tour to see where Alcott wrote and set Little Women . Visitors can also get a look at Alcott’s writing desk and the family’s original furniture and paintings. </p>

<p> The Reason Why The Great Gatsby Isn’t In the Public Domain (Yet) </p>
<p> Copyright laws in America are incredibly complicated, especially for books. Though F. Scott Fitzgerald’s Great American Novel The Great Gatsby was published in 1925, it won’t enter the public domain until January 1, 2021. Why is that? </p>
<p> In 1976, Congress passed the Copyright Act of 1976, which revised copyright laws from 1909. When the act went into effect in 1978, it extended copyright protection throughout the life of an author plus 50 years after their death. Another section stated that anonymous works, pseudonymous works, and works made for hire were copyrighted 75 years from publication. </p>
<p> Sonny Bono—who was not only half of Sonny and Cher but also the mayor of Palm Springs, California from 1988 to 1992 and a California congressman—is one person who is responsible The Great Gatsby's public domain delay. In 1998, Congress passed the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, which extends the Copyright Act of 1976. The latter established that works like The Great Gatsby would become public domain 75 years after the date of publication. But the 1998 act extended the publication date for certain works—namely: those published with a copyright notice and with copyright renewed—20 more years, giving The Great Gatsby a total of 95 years copyright protection. (The bill was named for Bono when the law passed the House of Representatives shortly after his death in 1998.) That means that The Great Gatsby—and many other books—won’t enter the public domain until long after publication; in this case January 1, 2021. </p>
<p> However, Fitzgerald’s pre-1923 works like This Side of Paradise (1920) and The Beautiful and the Damned (1922) are already in the public domain. </p>
<p> Gizmodo argues that having these copyright restrictions on older books is detrimental to literary history. “Between excessively long copyright terms and the uncertainty of public domain status, creating new works that depend on the commons has become difficult and dangerous,” they note. “A diminished public domain doesn’t just rob us of past works, but of the future works that could rely on an expanded public domain.” </p>
<p> One study done on books for sale on Amazon revealed that books published after 1923 are “available at a dramatically lower rate than books from even an entire century before," as Gizmodo put it. </p>
<p> The good news is that unless Congress decides to extend the Copyright Act further, we can look forward to The Great Gatsby becoming part of the public domain soon. </p>
<p> 12 Literary Writers on Stephen King’s Influence </p>
<p> Happy Birthday to the King of Horror </p>
<p> Stephen King—prolific writer, mega-bestseller, living author with the most film adaptations to his name, crowned king of horror but by no means limited to that genre—turns 70 today. Despite (or perhaps because of) his relentless success, there have been many conversations over the years about whether Stephen King is a “great writer” or not. (I recommend this hilarious essay about the experience of reading It.) Some of the contention has originated with King himself—in his aggressive acceptance speech upon winning the National Book Foundation’s Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, he admitted to early bitterness about literary writers and called readers of literary fiction “out of touch with their own culture.” To which Shirley Hazzard, winning the National Book Award for fiction that year, responded, essentially: slow your roll. But the truth is that lots of people love Stephen King’s books, and that they’ve ushered many readers—and many eventual writers—through their adolescence. For many, his books were the first to show what could be done with literature, beyond what was taught in school. Which is a wonderful thing. Here are twelve literary authors on their love for King, and the influence he’s had on their work. </p>

<p> “One writer . . . is Stephen King, who was also a formative influence on me, but he can do the whole spectrum from splatter to realism to the genuinely weird.” (Electric Literature) </p>
<p> “How do you learn how to do something? You watch your sibling do it. Or you watch your parents do it. And as long as you don’t plagiarize, there isn’t any problem with copying. What I mean by that—let’s say there was a Stephen King story that took place in Maine with a bunch of white working class people working in a factory in the middle of the night. I didn’t know anything about that, but I would write a short story that was about some black factory workers at a factory in Queens at midnight and then it turns out that there’s a pathway down to an underground maze of rats. And it was a complete steal of one of Stephen King’s stories but that didn’t matter. What mattered was that I was teaching myself to tell a story and how to include the details that I knew, of a story that I knew.” (LA Times) </p>

<p> “The first book I ever loved, like walked around with it and never let it go, was probably Stephen King’s It. First, I’ll admit part of the lure was being able to show off that I was reading a book that massive. 1,000 pages or so. Even as a paperback that’s a beast. I slapped it down where ever I could just so people could feel the tremor. </p>
<p> But really the reason I loved the book is because children died in it. Right from the opening scene. I know this sounds morbid. I guess that’s because it is morbid. But I found the varieties of threat, and murder, done to children extremely appealing. When I was young I thought it was just the surprise of finding such things written down in a novel. But as an adult I now think there was also something so gratifying about having a book acknowledge, admit, revel in the feeling of childhood. That you are under constant threat, that you have very little power, that there are forces in the world that simply will do you harm. Adults don’t like to think about this, but kids can’t ever forget such things are true. It didn’t lie to me.” (Literary Hub) </p>

<p> “I love Stephen King and I owe him more than I could ever express. I love his wild imagination and his vivid scenes, many of which populate my nightmares even decades after I last read the books they’re in. But the greatest thing I gleaned most from reading Stephen King is his big-hearted glee, the way he treats writing with gratitude, the way he sees his job not as the source of anguish and pain many writers self-pityingly see it as, but rather as something he’s over-the-moon delighted to be lucky enough to do. If I could steal one thing from King, and keep it close to my heart forever, it is his sense of almost-holy glee when it comes to writing.” (Salon) </p>

<p> “My family read a lot of commercial fiction. We always had the latest Stephen King. My mother would read it first, and then my sister, and then I would get it, starting in fifth grade. The first big book I read was Night Shift by Stephen King, you know, a huge book of short stories. And so for many years I just wanted to write horror fiction.” (Literary Hub) </p>
<p> “I was a big horror and science fiction fan growing up. My brother and I would rent horror movies every weekend and in junior high I was reading Stephen King and Isaac Asimov. It was those guys who made me want to write in the first place, so it made sense to me that I would eventually do a horror novel, even if it seems strange going from a coming-of-age story like my last novel, Sag Harbor, to a zombie apocalypse. Zombies are a great rhetorical prop to talk about people and paranoia and they are a good vehicle for my misanthropy.” (The Guardian) </p>
<p> “[In college] I wanted to write the black Shining or the black Salem’s Lot . . . Take any Stephen King title and put ‘the black’ in front of it. That’s basically what I wanted to do.” (VCU) </p>

<p> “I do reread books and stories, all the time. Often children’s books and ghost stories, especially anthologies of ghost stories. Stephen King’s novels or collections. I reread things that I loved, or that had a particular effect on me. I once asked a bunch of horror writers why it was still pleasurable to reread scary stories when their power to scare us has diminished. The writer Nick Mamatas said, ‘I read to feel a sense of dread.'” (LARB) </p>

<p> “Stephen King saved my life. . . . Stephen King saved my life strictly in the sense that after an especially humiliating junior high school afternoon (acid-washed jeans, a chair puddled with red paint, you get the rest), it was re-reading Itthat persuaded me not to run away and join the circus. Or at least not to quit school and get a job at the Gap. If the Losers Club could defeat knife-wielding bullies and a monstrous sewer clown, I reasoned, then surely I could take a stab at surviving the junior high cafeteria. After that day, the books I loved became the books I lived on. They were fresh air and security blanket in one; they were not only an acknowledgment that evil existed (you needed only meet my gym teacher to buy that) but an assurance that someone like me, needy and lonely and young, could defeat it.” (The Atlantic) </p>

<p> “I always tell people my literary influences are Stephen King, John Steinbeck, and my mother, my grandfather and the Brady Bunch.” (Interview with Thomson Highway) </p>
<p> “Oh my gosh. Stephen King, who was always writing about underdogs, and bullied kids, and kids fighting back against overwhelming, often supernatural forces [has stuck with me]. The world aligned against them. </p>
<p> As an Indian boy growing up on a reservation, I always identified with his protagonists. Stephen King, fighting the monsters.” (State Impact) </p>

<p> Tom Perrotta: </p>
<p> “I admire Stephen King not primarily for being our foremost writer of horror and suspense—though he is that—but as an artist of colloquial English, a master storyteller whose voice is so natural and unaffected that it seems to be coming from deep in our collective unconscious, the wellspring of small-town middle America. For me, as for many other ‘literary’ writers, King’s masterpiece is Different Seasons. Every one of those novellas is a great achievement.” (Salon) </p>

<p> Benjamin Percy: </p>
<p> “Stephen King’s It awakened my brain, opened up emotional chambers I didn’t know existed. I related so closely to the seven kids who make up the Losers’ Club—their dreams and anxieties my own—and by following them into adulthood, I grew up a little myself. I remember passages from that book so vividly I might as well have lived them. And this is not unique to It, which was published in 1986 and is getting a new film adaptation on September 8. I might own nearly all of King’s books, but really, they own me. And I’m not alone in this way. So many of us were raised by him. </p>
<p> . . . </p>
<p> He is there—on every train track, at every lakeside cabin, in every culvert and marsh and funeral parlor, every bathroom and walk-in freezer and hogpen and high school dance—imprisoning me in a world of wonder and horror. Dostoyevsky might have said that “we all come out from Gogol’s overcoat,” but for this loyal reader, we all come out of King’s sewer grate. I don’t think I’m exaggerating when I say his cultural influence might be second only to Shakespeare’s.” (Departures) </p>

<p> “Swamplandia! . . . owes a big debt to Stephen King’s The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon. I think that’s one of the most beautiful books. For King it’s pretty quiet, about this nine year old girl wandering around the woods in Appalachia. It’s weird to me that King is as popular as he is, you know? Because of the places he goes. That’s an acknowledgement of how weird we all must be, and how we love the dark. I feel like he’s some organ, doing extrasensory processing for all of us!” (The Millions) </p>

<p> Bret Easton Ellis: </p>
<p> “The impetus to write [Lunar Park] came from wanting to mimic the books I loved as a boy and a teenager—specifically the Stephen King novels I devoured as well as both the Warren Comics of the 70’s (Creepy, Eerie, Vampirilla) and the slightly less edgy EC Comics (Vault of Horror, Tales From the Crypt). I guess I basically wanted to re-experience the pleasure I got from reading something like The Shining or The Dark Half.” (The Cult) </p>
<p> “He was a major writer for me as a kid, and as an adolescent. I was thrilled every time a Stephen King book came out. I’d spend pocket money on hardbacks. Man, they were the first hardbacks that I demanded my parents get for me. I remember buying It and thinking it was the most epic horror novel—that it was the Ulysses of horror. </p>
<p> . . . </p>
<p> When the idea first occurred to me, I thought I’m going to write my Stephen King novel. I was at a ranch, in North Dakota, walking around. It was a week after Christmas. It was snowy. I went for a walk by myself. I’d just finished writing American Psycho, I’d just sent it off the week before, a week before Christmas. And I wanted to write something different—something fun. Writing American Psycho was fun—but it also took me into weird dark places. I didn’t want to write something that was so violent and so pornographic. During that walk I thought ‘haunted house’. Yeah, haunted house! I’d said in interviews at the time that I was thinking about a high school and vampires because I liked ‘Salem’s Lot so much. And I could’ve gone there, I suppose – but the haunted house thing kept announcing itself. That was IT! There was NOTHING! ELSE! Just a full throttle fun house ride! That was all I wanted to do. Simple.” (Bookmunch) </p>

<p> “I love pop culture—the Rolling Stones, the Doors, David Lynch, things like that. That’s why I said I don’t like elitism. I like horror films, Stephen King, Raymond Chandler, detective stories. I don’t want to write those things. What I want to do is use those structures, not the content. I like to put my content in that structure. That’s my way, my style. So both of those kinds of writers don’t like me. Entertainment writers don’t like me, and serious literature people don’t like me. I’m kind of in-between, doing a new kind of thing.” (Salon) </p>

<p> “I also grew up as a reader of fantasy and sci-fi. I can talk Cormac McCarthy all day but Stephen King is just as important to me. It’s good to allow yourself to be influenced by whatever you’re really influenced by, not just what you supposed to be influenced by.” (12th St) </p>

<p> Is Stephen King a great writer? </p>
<p> He’s one of the best-selling authors of all time but his work doesn’t get much respect from the literary establishment. Jane Ciabattari asks if that’s fair. </p>
<p> Stephen King has had an uncanny ability to hit the commercial bull’s-eye from the beginning of his career. In the 40 years since his first novel, Carrie, he has published more than 50 books, all of them international best sellers. Shortly after its release, Carrie was turned into a blood-drenched film by Brian De Palma. And in 1977 King’s novel The Shining, set in a wintry ski resort and featuring a paranormal child and a maniacal father, further showcased his unparalleled gift for psychological terror. When Stanley Kubrick turned that novel into a film in 1980, the Stephen King industry was born. There are now more than 100 films and TV programmes based on his work, and he shows no signs of slowing down – not with his legions of fans, hungry for more. </p>
<p> But the respect of the literary establishment has always eluded King. For years, the question of whether he was a serious writer was answered by a quick tabulation of book sales, film deals, income and sheer volume of output, which added up to a resounding ‘no’. Commercial triumph did not equal literary value. Being a best seller was anathema. (Tell that to 21st-Century authors like Chimamanda Adichie, Richard Flanagan and Donna Tartt, who have translated literary laurels into sales.) </p>
<p> From the beginning, King was dismissed as a ‘genre writer’. But really, he is polymorphous. In addition to horror, science fiction and fantasy novels, he has written historical fiction (his recent 11/22/63, in which a man travels back in time to kill Lee Harvey Oswald, won a Los Angeles Times book award and was a New York Times ‘top ten of the year’ pick), Westerns and literary short stories, which he describes as “the way I affirm, at least to myself, the fact that I haven't sold out”. </p>
<p> The curse of popularity </p>
<p> King has always been clear about the inspiration he has drawn from respected literary forebears. His short story The Man in the Black Suit, an homage to Hawthorne about a man who meets the devil on a walk through the woods, won an O Henry award after being published in The New Yorker. His ongoing connection with and affinity to Edgar Allen Poe was first made explicit with his 1975 version of The Tell Tale Heart, retitled Old Dude’s Ticker. HP Lovecraft inspired his 1987 science fiction novel The Tommyknockers, and King’s work also has similarities with the work of inventive literary authors: George Saunders, Karen Russell, Karen Joy Fowler, Michael Chabon, to name a few who blur genre boundaries, dabble in fantasy and adopt the conventions of horror and fantasy without losing respect. </p>
<p> But does any of this really mean we should take King seriously? The question is sure to rise again in November with the publication of Revival, a ‘pact with the Devil’ novel featuring a New England-born rocker with addiction issues and yet another diabolical reverend. My answer is a conditional ‘yes’. He keeps millions of readers engaged at a crucial time in the world of books, as technology continues to transform reading in unpredictable ways. King has been one of the first to experiment with new technologies, coming up with online serial novels and the first downloadable e-book, Riding the Bullet. </p>
<p> At his best, King is a masterful storyteller. He is able to create worlds infused with a sense of right and wrong, good and evil. He writes of familiar family crises, fears of the unknown and the yearning to belong. At a time when we are barraged with horrifying events – beheadings, Ebola, serial killers, plane crashes, police shootings, mass murders, cyberbullying – his visceral stories provide a catharsis, sometimes even a sense of order. Some victims can be avenged in fiction, if not in life. King may simplify, but he does it without contempt for his characters or readers. He may write too much, but his best work endures. He may be, at times, sophomoric, but he also can be superbly Gothic. </p>
<p> Canon fodder? </p>
<p> I put the question of King’s literary merit to Yale University’s Harold Bloom, the legendary critic and author of The Western Canon. Bloom issued a stinging rebuke of King in 2003, when King was given the US National Book Foundation’s annual award for ‘distinguished contribution to American letters’. Bloom called the honour “another low in the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life. I've described King in the past as a writer of penny dreadfuls, but perhaps even that is too kind. He shares nothing with Edgar Allan Poe. What he is is an immensely inadequate writer on a sentence-by-sentence, paragraph-by-paragraph, book-by-book basis.” </p>
<p> Is it possible Harold Bloom might have changed his mind over the last tumultuous decade? It seems not. “Stephen King is beneath the notice of any serious reader who has experienced Proust, Joyce, Henry James, Faulkner and all the other masters of the novel,” Bloom tells me. </p>
<p> From the other side of the genre divide, I posed the question to the prolific horror writer Peter Straub. Straub has a shelf full of Bram Stoker awards and has edited multiple anthologies, including Poe's Children and the Library of America edition of HP Lovecraft's Tales; he collaborated with King on The Talisman (1984) and its 2001 sequel Black House. “It's an odd question,” says Straub, who ranks King with Dickens, Wilkie Collins, Raymond Chandler, Bram Stoker and Conan Doyle. "In a way, it has been asked about him almost since he began publishing. In the late ‘70s, the question was really rhetorical, because the answer was understood to be ‘no’. A writer with such immediate access to the imagination of so many readers, a lot of them unsophisticated, could not presume to seriousness. Now, his readership is even larger and more inclusive and the similarities between King and Dickens, always visible to those who cared for King's work, have become all but unavoidable. Both are novelists of vast popularity and enormous bibliographies, both are beloved writers with a pronounced taste for the morbid and grotesque, both display a deep interest in the underclass.” </p>
<p> In his time, Dickens was reviled by high-brow contemporaries, including George Eliot, who attacked him for “enjoying an extravagantly high reputation” and “being rewarded for his labours, both in purse and in credit, at an extravagantly high rate.” Eliot posed the same question that dogs Stephen King: “Who, it may be asked, takes Mr Dickens seriously? Is it not foolish to estimate his melodramatic and sentimental stock-in-trade gravely?” Dickens has stood the test of time. Today no-one disputes his worth. The best of Stephen King’s work is has become so embedded in the culture I suspect he faces a similar fate. </p>

<p> 20 things you (probably) didn't know about Stephen King </p>
<p> Stephen King is the Big Mac of writers (his words, not ours). Unavoidable – an institution. However, unlike the fast food restaurant, King is actually good for your soul and today is his 70th birthday. Which means that he’s been publishing excellent pieces of horror-tinged prose for 44 years and is still going. </p>
<p> Which is pretty incredible. King’s writing is witty, profound and, depending on what age you read his books, a master of suspense/bone chillingly scary (delete as appropriate). </p>
<p> But how much do you know about the man behind Carrie, The Shining, The Dead Zone, Misery, It, Pet Sematary and much, much more? </p>
<p> What follows are 20 things you probably didn’t know about Stephen King. </p>
<p> 1 </p>
<p> He suffers from triskaidekaphobia – fear of the number 13. “The number 13 never fails to trace that old icy finger up and down my spine. When I'm writing, I'll never stop work if the page number is 13 or a multiple of 13; I'll just keep on typing till I get to a safe number. I always take the last two steps on my back stairs as one, making 13 into 12. There were after all 13 steps on the English gallows up until 1900 or so. When I'm reading, I won't stop on page 94, 193, or 382, since the sums of these numbers add up to 13.” </p>
<p> 2 </p>
<p> A collection of short stories by HP Lovecraft called The Lurker Of The Threshold has often been cited by King as a catalyst in becoming a writer. It was his absent father’s book and he found it in the attic. The cover of the book featured a demon. </p>
<p> 3 </p>
<p> He once said in a BBC interview that Jack Torrance (The Shining) was his most autobiographical character. At the time he wrote the book he was drinking a lot like Jack. Originally he saw Jack “as a heroic character battling his demons the way strong American men are supposed to do.” </p>
<p> 4 </p>
<p> The Onion once wrote an article claiming that King couldn’t remember writing The Tommyknockers. He then admitted that it was actually true as he couldn’t remember writing many novels from the 80s due to his alcoholism, including Cujo. </p>
<p> 5 </p>
<p> King and his wife Tabitha own three radio stations in their home state of Maine. </p>
<p> 6 </p>
<p> When it was revealed that the writer Richard Bachman was in fact Stephen King, he retired the alias citing that Bachman had died. The cause of death was given as cancer of the pseudonym. </p>
<p> 7 </p>
<p> He told fellow author Neil Gaiman that if he had the chance to live his life all over again he wouldn’t change a thing. Apart from appearing in an American Express advert. </p>
<p> 8 </p>
<p> According to Guinness Superlatives more of King’s books have been adapted into films than any other living author. </p>
<p> 9 </p>
<p> King was declared unfit for military service in Vietnam because the draft board found him 4-F on grounds of high blood pressure, limited vision, flat feet and punctured eardrums. </p>
<p> 10 </p>
<p> A big fan of The Ramones, he wrote the liner notes for their 2003 tribute album, We’re A Happy Family. </p>
<p> 11 </p>
<p> King was always interested in drama and cropped up in a number of his movies. He was a man at the ATM in Maximum Overdrive, a minister in Pet Sematary, a cemetery caretaker in Sleepwalkers, Teddy Weizak in The Stand, Tom Holby in The Langoliers, Dr Bangor in Thinner, Gage Creed in the TV version of The Shining and a pizza delivery guy in Rose Red. </p>
<p> 12 </p>
<p> Originally, he threw the first draft of Carrie, originally intended as a short story, away but it was his wife Tabitha who saw potential and urged him to continue on with it. He ended up dedicating the book to her. </p>
<p> 13 </p>
<p> The original title for Salem's Lot was Second Coming but, again, King's wife Tabitha stepped in and remarked that it sounded like a "bad sex story" so it was eventually changed. </p>
<p> 14 </p>
<p> Rage, his first novel as Richard Bachman, was about a disturbed high school student who held his classmates at gunpoint. After Jeffery Lyne Cox, a disturbed high school student, held his classmates hostage, was found to have read and been inspired by the book and then three similar incidents, King let Rage fall out of print in the US. </p>
<p> 15 </p>
<p> King was once mistaken for a vandal when he started signing books during an unannounced visit to an Australian book shop. </p>
<p> 16 </p>
<p> He loved the movie 28 Days Later so much that he bought out an entire screening of it, all 275 tickets. </p>
<p> (Images: Rex/AllStar) </p>
<p> 17 </p>
<p> Reportedly, King attended a screening of Pan's Labyrinth and sat next to director Guillermo Del Toro. During the infamous Pale Man chase scene, King squirmed in his seat which Del Toro described as "the best experience ever". </p>
<p> 18 </p>
<p> Ronald McDonald was one of the influences for Pennywise. </p>
<p> 19 </p>
<p> After his near-fatal accident in 1999, King's homecare nurses were told by their supervisor that under no circumstances were they allowed to make any Misery jokes... </p>
<p> 20 </p>
<p> A Carrie musical? Yes, in 1988 it became an actual thing. Firstly by the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-Upon-Avon, England and then on Broadway later that year. Despite being sold out most nights, the reaction was extremely mixed and the $8 million show was closed after only 16 previews and 5 performances. It was brought back briefly in 2012 in an off-Broadway production. </p>

<p> I loved Stephen Kings first works a lot better. But have them all. Still my all time favorite author. </p>
<p> Stephen King is my all time favorite author... just now getting my collection back together </p>
<p> Looks like they were co-written to me, but Goodreads is only displaying the first author here. </p>
<p> Stephen King's son also writes books but he does not go by his regular name he writes under a different name and I forget what it is. </p>
<p> Karla wrote: "Because now that I remember Joe Hill is Stephen King's son" </p>
<p> I know that, still the question is why is he on a list of his father? This list is about King & not about his collab with others. (There seems to be Straub in here, too, so I guees it must be collaborations.) </p>
<p> I think that it is also with some of the other authors that he has written with... I have also heard the Stephen King even writes as Peter Straub... But I don't know about that.... But they are probably trying to add some of the books that he has helped other authors write as well </p>
<p> Karla wrote: "I think that it is also with some of the other authors that he has written with... I have also heard the Stephen King even writes as Peter Straub... But I don't know about that.... But they are pro..." </p>
<p> I think you rather mean Richard Bachman, an 'alter ego' of King, that would be okay. But Straub is someone(and yes he is an entirely other human being, so not a pen name) with whom he has co-written. :) </p>
<p> okay thats right I don't own any of his other books as he has him writing as Richard Bachman </p>
<p> Kyle ~Special K: Rebel Leader~ wrote: "Ɲėṩṛīȵ wrote: "What the Hell are Books by Joe Hill doing in this List? Nepotism much?" </p>
<p> That's a good question." </p>
<p> He's Stephen King's son. but shouldn't be on this list. </p>
<p> stephen king.....the absolute best ever. this list is missing some of his best work. </p>
<p> adore this man no one does character writing like Stephen king i have read 14 of his novels and i am steadily working my way through all of his books and i don't have a clue what i am doing to do when i run out!! </p>
<p> I actually like IT way better than The Stand, but other than that I totally agree with the first ten on the list. Still planning to read The Green Mile, too. </p>
<p> I am your biggest fan Mr. King, I am so glad I was born in the era with him as an author. If I didn't know better I think he was the 1 who wrote ( The book of Revolations ) for the Bible. And I 'd love to know how much of Lisey's Story - did he live. I read it when it 1st came out. it's his only book that haunts my dream & soul, there is just something about that story that make's me wonder. </p>
<p> Just finished Doctor Sleep, the sequel to The Shining (which I haven't read(yet)). First Stephen King book I've ever read and it was fantastic! </p>
<p> I honestly think that the stuff he did as Bachman is some of his best work. Especially The Long Walk. </p>
<p> I grew up reading Stephen King. Even now, his work still amazes me. He is the only author who has truly scared me from his books :) (That's a good thing). 'Salem's Lot is my all time favorite. This is when the best vampire book was ever written! Thank you Mr. King, my favorite author, for the hours of joy (and terror) I've had reading your novels. </p>
<p> I think that is difficult chooese between all the novels. But I have a predilection for the old ones rather the new books. </p>
<p> Great. Does this cover all of his works? Actually, I haven't read even one of his books. Only watched some of the movies like Pet Sematary and 1404. </p>
<p> Narayanan wrote: "Great. Does this cover all of his works? Actually, I haven't read even one of his books. Only watched some of the movies like Pet Sematary and 1404." </p>
<p> I like to read HORROR books...Only Stephen King is the best author to write horror and thrilling book... I love horror because I read his book since I was child and now I'm grown up with his book... I love you always Stephen King and I will always support you... </p>

<p> I wanna read "The Stand" but I cant find in spanish. Someone told me that editorials translate it to "Apocalipsis". Could somebody please confirm that this is right? Is one of the few King books im missing. Thanks! </p>
<p> The #35 and #36 books on this list are ones that Stephen King himself stated are badly written. </p>
<p> On #35 Stephen King has stated that their has to be a 300 page novel in here somewhere. </p>

<p> Stephen King quotes Showing 1-30 of 8,313 </p>
<p> “If you don't have time to read, you don't have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that.” ― Stephen King </p>
<p> “Books are the perfect entertainment: no commercials, no batteries, hours of enjoyment for each dollar spent. What I wonder is why everybody doesn't carry a book around for those inevitable dead spots in life.” ― Stephen King </p>
<p> “When his life was ruined, his family killed, his farm destroyed, Job knelt down on the ground and yelled up to the heavens, "Why god? Why me?" and the thundering voice of God answered, There's just something about you that pisses me off.” ― Stephen King, Storm of the Century </p>
<p> “Monsters are real, and ghosts are real too. They live inside us, and sometimes, they win.” ― Stephen King </p>
<p> “The most important things are the hardest to say. They are the things you get ashamed of, because words diminish them -- words shrink things that seemed limitless when they were in your head to no more than living size when they're brought out. But it's more than that, isn't it? The most important things lie too close to wherever your secret heart is buried, like landmarks to a treasure your enemies would love to steal away. And you may make revelations that cost you dearly only to have people look at you in a funny way, not understanding what you've said at all, or why you thought it was so important that you almost cried while you were saying it. That's the worst, I think. When the secret stays locked within not for want of a teller but for want of an understanding ear.” ― Stephen King </p>
<p> “Both Rowling and Meyer, they’re speaking directly to young people. … The real difference is that Jo Rowling is a terrific writer and Stephenie Meyer can’t write worth a darn. She’s not very good.” ― Stephen King </p>
<p> “Some birds are not meant to be caged, that's all. Their feathers are too bright, their songs too sweet and wild. So you let them go, or when you open the cage to feed them they somehow fly out past you. And the part of you that knows it was wrong to imprison them in the first place rejoices, but still, the place where you live is that much more drab and empty for their departure.” ― Stephen King, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption: A Story from Different Seasons </p>
<p> “If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot.” ― Stephen King </p>
<p> “I think that we're all mentally ill. Those of us outside the asylums only hide it a little better - and maybe not all that much better after all.” ― Stephen King </p>
<p> “If you liked being a teenager, there's something really wrong with you.” ― Stephen King </p>
<p> “Alone. Yes, that's the key word, the most awful word in the English tongue. Murder doesn't hold a candle to it and hell is only a poor synonym.” ― Stephen King </p>
<p> “A short story is a different thing altogether – a short story is like a quick kiss in the dark from a stranger.” ― Stephen King, Skeleton Crew </p>
<p> “Speaking personally, you can have my gun, but you'll take my book when you pry my cold, dead fingers off of the binding.” ― Stephen King </p>
<p> “The thing under my bed waiting to grab my ankle isn't real. I know that, and I also know that if I'm careful to keep my foot under the covers, it will never be able to grab my ankle.” ― Stephen King, Night Shift </p>
<p> “Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman's got to hold on to.” ― Stephen King, Dolores Claiborne </p>
<p> “That wasn't any act of God. That was an act of pure human fuckery.” ― Stephen King, The Stand </p>
<p> “Hearts can break. Yes, hearts can break. Sometimes I think it would be better if we died when they did, but we don't.” ― Stephen King, Hearts in Atlantis </p>
<p> “Remember, Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.” ― Stephen King </p>
<p> “A little talent is a good thing to have if you want to be a writer. But the only real requirement is the ability to remember every scar.” ― Stephen King </p>
<p> “Description begins in the writer’s imagination, but should finish in the reader’s.” ― Stephen King, On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft </p>
<p> “I do not aim with my hand; he who aims with his hand has forgotten the face of his father. I aim with my eye. </p>
<p> I do not shoot with my hand; he who shoots with his hand has forgotten the face of his father. I shoot with my mind. </p>
<p> I do not kill with my gun; he who kills with his gun has forgotten the face of his father. I kill with my heart.” ― Stephen King, The Gunslinger </p>

<p> Mini Bio (1) </p>
<p> Stephen Edwin King was born on September 21, 1947, at the Maine General Hospital in Portland. His parents were Nellie Ruth (Pillsbury), who worked as a caregiver at a mental institute, and Donald Edwin King, a merchant seaman. His father was born under the surname "Pollock," but used the last name "King," under which Stephen was born. He has an older brother, David. The Kings were a typical family until one night, when Donald said he was stepping out for cigarettes and was never heard from again. Ruth took over raising the family with help from relatives. They traveled throughout many states over several years, finally moving back to Durham, Maine, in 1958. </p>
<p> Stephen began his actual writing career in January of 1959, when David and Stephen decided to publish their own local newspaper named "Dave's Rag". David bought a mimeograph machine, and they put together a paper they sold for five cents an issue. Stephen attended Lisbon High School, in Lisbon, in 1962. Collaborating with his best friend Chris Chesley in 1963, they published a collection of 18 short stories called "People, Places, and Things--Volume I". King's stories included "Hotel at the End of the Road", "I've Got to Get Away!", "The Dimension Warp", "The Thing at the Bottom of the Well", "The Stranger", "I'm Falling", "The Cursed Expedition", and "The Other Side of the Fog." A year later, King's amateur press, Triad and Gaslight Books, published a two-part book titled "The Star Invaders". </p>
<p> King made his first actual published appearance in 1965 in the magazine Comics Review with his story "I Was a Teenage Grave Robber." The story ran about 6,000 words in length. In 1966 he graduated from high school and took a scholarship to attend the University of Maine. Looking back on his high school days, King recalled that "my high school career was totally undistinguished. I was not at the top of my class, nor at the bottom." Later that summer King began working on a novel called "Getting It On", about some kids who take over a classroom and try unsuccessfully to ward off the National Guard. During his first year at college, King completed his first full-length novel, "The Long Walk." He submitted the novel to Bennett Cerf/Random House only to have it rejected. King took the rejection badly and filed the book away. </p>
<p> He made his first small sale--$35--with the story "The Glass Floor". In June 1970 King graduated from the University of Maine with a Bachelor of Science degree in English and a certificate to teach high school. King's next idea came from the poem by Robert Browning, "Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came." He found bright colored green paper in the library and began work on "The Dark Tower" saga, but his chronic shortage of money meant that he was unable to further pursue the novel, and it, too, was filed away. King took a job at a filling station pumping gas for the princely sum of $1.25 an hour. Soon he began to earn money for his writings by submitting his short stories to men's magazines such as Cavalier. </p>
<p> On January 2, 1971, he married Tabitha King (born Tabitha Jane Spruce). In the fall of 1971 King took a teaching job at Hampden Academy, earning $6,400 a year. The Kings then moved to Hermon, a town west of Bangor. Stephen then began work on a short story about a teenage girl named Carietta White. After completing a few pages, he decided it was not a worthy story and crumpled the pages up and tossed them into the trash. Fortunately, Tabitha took the pages out and read them. She encouraged her husband to continue the story, which he did. In January 1973 he submitted "Carrie" to Doubleday. In March Doubleday bought the book. On May 12 the publisher sold the paperback rights for the novel to New American Library for $400,000. His contract called for his getting half of that sum, and he quit his teaching job to pursue writing full time. The rest, as they say, is history. </p>
<p> Since then King has had numerous short stories and novels published and movies made from his work. He has been called the "Master of Horror". His books have been translated into 33 different languages, published in over 35 different countries. There are over 300 million copies of his novels in publication. He continues to live in Bangor, Maine, with his wife, and writes out of his home. </p>
<p> In June 1999 King was severely injured in an accident, he was walking alongside a highway and was hit by a car, that left him in critical condition with injuries to his lung, broken ribs, a broken leg and a severely fractured hip. After three weeks of operations, he was released from the Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston. </p>

Another rumor (perhaps started by King) claims that, if sent a book to sign, he will burn it and return the ashes. This is also untrue and was debunked by his official website. </p>

<p> Biography/bibliography in: "Contemporary Authors". New Revision Series, vol. 134, pages 256-271. Farmington Hills, MI: Thomson Gale, 2005. </p>
<p> A huge fan of Ramones, King penned the liner notes to the 2002 Ramones tribute album, "We're A Happy Family.". </p>
<p> Writes reviews of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series for Entertainment Weekly magazine. </p>
<p> The fictional town of Castle Rock is located in Maine. Stůj při mně (1986), accidentally set it in Oregon. This is because the original story, "The Body," only mentions that Castle Rock is near Portland, without identifying which state. It is only identified as being in Maine in his other stories. The only clues in "The Body" that it takes place in Maine is the fact that the local radio stations begin with W, which, with only a few exceptions, applies only to stations east of the Mississippi River. </p>
<p> Many of his stories take place in or near the fictional small town of Castle Rock, Maine. The first film to be based on a Castle Rock story was Mrtvá zóna (1983). Director Rob Reiner subsequently named his production company Castle Rock Entertainment. </p>
<p> Was such a fan of the film 28 dní poté (2002) that he bought out an entire showing of the film in New York City. </p>
<p> Son Joseph Hillstrom King is also a novelist. He spent the past several years writing under the pen name Joe Hill, the name of a labor leader who is also his namesake. </p>
<p> Cites Sir William Golding's novel Lord of the Flies as a major influence on him. One of the chapters in that book was "Castle Rock," which later became the name of a fictional town in several of King's stories. </p>
<p> Worked as an English teacher before becoming a professional writer. Many of his characters are also teachers. </p>
<p> In his book "On Writing", he states that as punishment for making fun of Ellen Margitan, the vice principal of Lisbon High, he is sent to the offices of the Lisbon Enterprise to work with the editor, John Gould which he states is not "the" John Gould. In fact, it was "the" John Gould, famous Maine humorist and it was John Gould that helped King develop into a writer that people wanted to read. </p>
<p> He's a huge fan of the hit ABC TV show Ztraceni (2004), which often makes references to his works. He even trusted J.J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof to adapt the "Dark Tower" series into a film series. </p>
<p> After watching the first cut of Rob Reiner 's Stůj při mně (1986), he was said to be crying and stated it was the closest adaptation to one of his novels he'd ever seen. </p>
<p> A fan of J.K. Rowling and the Harry Potter novels. </p>
<p> Controversially, King once wrote a complimentary "Blurb" for the back cover of L. Ron Hubbard's book "Fear". </p>
<p> When it was discovered in 1985 that he and Richard Bachman were one and the same, he retired the use of that name. He resurrected Bachman about a decade later, using the name as the author of The Regulators, a companion piece to his own novel Desperation. Since then, he has issued other new novels using the name Bachman, with the dust jackets jokingly claiming the books to have been a posthumous discovery by Bachman's widow. Bachman is said to have died in 1985 from "Cancer of the Pseudonym". </p>
<p> Will allow aspiring film-makers to purchase the film rights to any of his short stories (and only short-stories, not novels) for a dollar. The resulting films are sent directly to him and, if he enjoys them, placed on a shelf marked "Dollar-Babies.". </p>
<p> In 2009 he fulfilled a lifetime ambition, expressed in Salem's Lot, of being interviewed in Playboy Magazine. The Magazine also published a poem by King, entitled "The Bone Church", which featured the immortal line "And balls to your grinning face!". </p>
<p> His characters frequently meet other characters from other Stephen King books. In Tommyknockers, for example, poet Jim Gardner encounters Jack, from The Talisman, on a beach. </p>
<p> The description of the character Ben Mears, in Salem's Lot, is taken from King himself. </p>
<p> As a little boy he had a recurring nightmare in which he entered a room and saw a suicide victim hanging from the ceiling. He later incorporated this scene into an early book, Salem's Lot. </p>
<p> Famously disliked Stanley Kubrick's Osvícení (1980), which was adapted from his novel of the same name. King was opposed to the casting of Jack Nicholson who, in his opinion, did not accurately portray the gradual descent into madness that the book had described. He also lamented that many story elements, some of them autobiographical and important to King, had not been included, such as alcoholism and his father issue. King therefore produced a mini series of Osvícení (1997) that follows his novel more closely, but is generally regarded as inferior to Kubrick's interpretation. </p>
<p> His novel Misery is about a writer with a recurring character in a long series of books, who is in a serious car accident after finishing the last book in the series. King was himself in the middle of an ongoing series; The Dark Tower; when he was hit by a truck in 1999. Surviving that accident is what ultimately prompted him to finish the series. He has recently decided to write one more book in the series, to be entitled The Wind in the Keyhole, due for a 2012 release. In Misery, the writer also decides to continue writing his series after surviving his encounter with an obsessed fan. </p>
<p> In 2011, his fondness for the Harry Potter books came full circle, when it was announced that Potter director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves would be making a new adaptation of his novel The Stand. </p>
<p> His memoir "On Writing" has been praised by Roger Ebert as the most useful and insightful book about writing since The Elements of Style. </p>
<p> A rumor circulated for years that he did not want to complete his novel "Pet Sematary" as it frightened him to do any writing for it. King or Doubleday (the publisher) may have started the story and while not exactly true it is partially based in fact. King fell into a depression while writing it and had no desire to complete it while feeling the strong melancholy. </p>
<p> Suicides have occurred in three of the houses the King family have lived in. </p>
<p> The first author to have three simultaneous titles on the publishers weekly list: Firestarter, The Dead Zone, and The Shining. </p>
<p> In October 1995, King broke his own record by having four books hit the NY Times bestseller list: Skeleton Crew, Thinner, The Talisman, and The Bachman Books. </p>
<p> All three of his children as well as his wife have followed his footsteps into writing. </p>
<p> Writes three drafts for every book. </p>
<p> His favourite way of relaxing is to take a bath while smoking a cigarette, and listen to a Red Sox game on the radio, propped on the sink. He would also drink a beer during the days when he was an alcoholic. </p>
<p> King played guitar (badly) in a high school band. He would often change the lyrics into something gross (but funny) on the spot. </p>
<p> In later years, movie studios and production companies snapped up the film rights for King novels before the books saw print, e.g. Delores Claiborne. </p>
<p> King writes for 3-4 hours a day. He used to write 2000-3000 words a day, now he can only manage 1000. </p>
<p> King once flew on a plane that ran into turbulence. The oxygen mask came out, and his seat was ripped from the floor and he landed on his side, still strapped in. It was a while before he could get on a plane again. </p>
<p> Against abortion because he likens it to abandonment, something his father did to him when he was a child. </p>
<p> Never answers his own phone. </p>
<p> He will never co-author a book with his wife, because he feels that if they ever did, it would lead to divorce court. </p>
<p> In 1993, King played with the Rock Bottom Remainders to sell-out arenas. </p>
<p> King has a deal with Castle Rock; they can have his work for a dollar, but he gets script approval, he approves the director, cast approval, and he can pull the plug anytime, no matter how much money was spent. He gets 5% of every dollar, so in the case of Zelená míle (1999), he made 25 million dollars. </p>
<p> King gets depressed when people say The Stand is his best book because that was written three decades ago and implies he hasn't written anything as good since. </p>
<p> When King was hit by a van in 1999, he was lucky not to have been killed outright. While in recovery, one of his lungs had collapsed, he had four broken ribs, a gash to the head that needed 20 stitches and his spine was chipped in eight places. His right leg almost had to be amputated but doctors managed to save it. The only thing undamaged in the accident were the lenses in King's glasses; he later replaced the frame. </p>
<p> During King's recovery after being knocked down by a van in 1999, he was appalled when he was hooked up to a morphine drip, what with his former past as a drug addict. He didn't become re-addicted by doctors keeping him below the recommended dose. He could feel the craving bubbling to the surface, but this time experience prepared him to recognize the danger signs. By the time he came home, he had lost 40 pounds. None of the nurses cracked any "Misery" jokes but he said he would have appreciated the dark irony. He could only write for up to an hour and a half every day, so he spent the Winter in Florida; the warm weather would aid his recovery. He still needs to walk with a cane though. After accepting a literary award in 2003, he had a relapse and had to spend another month in hospital. He weighed 160 pounds and nearly died. Tabitha took the opportunity to refurbish his office. </p>
<p> The one thing King is reluctant to write is an autobiography. The nearest he's ever come to that is the CV section of his non-fictional book On Writing. </p>
<p> Has a fear of therapists. He had to conquer that fear during the worst stages of his alcoholism and drug addiction. </p>
<p> Has a fear of flying. He once suffered an injury on an airplane when it flew into turbulence, which no doubt exacerbated his fear. </p>
<p> Hates being famous. He's also uncomfortable in large crowds. </p>
<p> Since the publication of Carrie in 1974, his books have never been out of print; a rare feat for an author. </p>
<p> Repeated the first grade because of frequent absences. </p>
<p> On the night King's mother died, his son had a terrible choking fit at home. He's had a fear of choking ever since. His mother's death drove him further into drink. </p>
<p> Because The Shining came from a very personal place, King managed to write the book very quickly. The subject matter hit so close to King that he took time out from it to work on his next novel, The Stand. </p>
<p> King invented the pseudonym Richard Bachman to see if he could market books without the attachment of his more famous name. </p>
<p> King used to listen to rock and roll when drafting a novel; now he doesn't need to. </p>
<p> Not long after 9/11, someone left a package on King's doorstep. The bomb squad were called in and incinerated it. It turns out it was King's novel, It. </p>
<p> King has a library made up of 17,000 books; he's read them all except for any new additions. </p>
<p> A big fan of detective stories. </p>
<p> The first American to win the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Canadian Booksellers Association. </p>
<p> When touring with the Rock Bottom Remainders, they needed extra security because of King's presence. </p>
<p> Before he wrote Carrie (his first published novel), King wrote a few practice novels first under his pseudonym Richard Bachman. He called them "trunk novels". </p>
<p> Regularly listens to audiobooks, because he believes no book exists until its done in audio. </p>
<p> King owns two neighboring houses in Bangor. He wanted to build an underground tunnel with a trolley you could ride between them. When asked why, he replied, "because I can". </p>
<p> Read many stories about people being buried alive. </p>
<p> He'd like to direct a film now that he's totally sober. </p>
<p> Would like to write a novel about the thing that scares him the most, spiders. </p>
<p> Hit the No 1 bestseller list 36 times, and is still disappointed when he doesn't. </p>
<p> King suffers from insomnia and later wrote a book about it. </p>
<p> Does some of his book tours on motorbike. </p>
<p> The one question King hates to be asked more than any other by the fans is "Where do you get your ideas?". </p>
<p> By 1987, the King family lived in a 24-room restored Victorian mansion. </p>
<p> King is critical of people who write about Maine and didn't grow up there. </p>
<p> Bryan Smith, the van driver who hit King in 1999, had a history of driving offenses and his license had been suspended three times by the time of the accident. He was indicted for aggravated assault and driving to endanger. He later died of a drug overdose. </p>
<p> Has a fear of the number 13, which is called triskaidekaphobia. </p>
<p> Prefers to be called Steve. </p>
<p> Had the idea for the Dark Tower series before he was an established author. </p>
<p> Suffers from high blood pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums. These spared him from being drafted into Vietnam. </p>
<p> King's first novel Getting It On was sent to an editor and then sent back for revisions four times. In the end it was still rejected, but it taught him much about the editing process. His second attempt The Long Walk failed as well. It wasn't until his third novel, Carrie, that he finally got a book published. </p>
<p> People will often camp outside King's house to get a view of the great author. A man named Erik Keene broke in April 20, 1991 at 6:00am. He threatened Tabitha with a bomb, claiming King stole the idea for Misery from Keene's aunt. She ran to a neighbour and called the police. They found Keene in the attic and the bomb was a dud. He was arrested and sentenced to 18 months in jail before he was extradited to Texas for a parole violation. The King's increased security by extending a wrought-iron fence around the yard gates with access codes as well as CCTV. </p>
<p> King is down to three cigarettes a day. He's kicked alcohol, cocaine, painkillers, but he's still addicted to work and goes into similar withdrawal when he's not working. </p>
<p> Has declared that this will be his last year of writing novels. His books will be published for the next few years, but he has vowed to quit the job in numerous publications on numerous occasions. [2002] </p>

<p> Writing a column for the back page of Entertainment Weekly magazine called "The Pop of King". [July 2003] </p>
<p> The recipient of the 2003 National Book Foundation Medal for distinguished contribution to American letters. </p>
<p> In his novel Doctor Sleep, he uses the line "the hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world"; Rebecca De Mornay was the star of the movie of the same name and played Wendy Torrance in the miniseries version of King's Osvícení (1997). </p>
<p> King writes his fear of flying into some of his stories, Eg The Langoliers. </p>
<p> When writing Doctor Sleep, King had to be reminded of things from The Shining he'd forgotten. </p>
<p> King novels are criticized for having a lot of swearing. This is commented on ironically by King himself in Misery and The Tommyknockers. </p>
<p> King has never understood why people find Osvícení (1980) so scary. </p>
<p> King wrote the dedication to Doctor Sleep in Bangor, Maine where he lives. </p>
<p> King has written very few sequels in his career. </p>
<p> When King wrote The Shining, the lead character was struggling with alcoholism just as King was at the time. But King didn't know about AA so Jack Torrance didn't go, but when King wrote the book as a miniseries, he did go. </p>
<p> Claimed that he realized he was an alcoholic when he began to save bottles for recycling. The piles of empty bottles made clear how much he drank regularly. </p>
<p> His ancestry includes English, German, Scots-Irish/Northern Irish, and distant Scottish, Welsh, Dutch, and French. </p>
<p> One of the only times he has scared himself with his own writing is when Patrick Hockstetter of "It" gets trapped in a refrigerator with leeches. </p>

<p> Preston Max Allen and his musical, "Carrie 2: The Rage (An Unauthorized Musical Parody)," at the Underscore Theatre Company in Chicago, Illinois, was nominated for a 2018 Non-Equity Joseph Jefferson Award for New Musical. </p>
<p> Personal Quotes (119) </p>
<p> I've killed enough of the world's trees. </p>
<p> I'm a salami writer. I try to write good salami, but salami is salami. </p>
<p> Each life makes its own imitation of immortality. </p>
<p> When asked, "How do you write?", I invariably answer, "One word at a time". </p>
<p> I recognize terror as the finest emotion and so I will try to terrorize the reader. But if I find that I cannot terrify, I will try to horrify, and if I find that I cannot horrify, I'll go for the gross-out. I'm not proud. </p>
<p> I am the literary equivalent of a Big Mac and fries. </p>
<p> For every six crappy poems you read, you'll actually find one or two good ones. And that, believe me, is a very acceptable ratio of trash to treasure. </p>
<p> People want to know why I do this, why I write such gross stuff. I like to tell them I have the heart of a small boy... and I keep it in a jar on my desk. </p>
<p> [asked why he hasn't personally directed more movies] Just watch Vzpoura strojů (1986). </p>
<p> [on playing the role of Jordy Verrill in Creepshow (1982)] If I had written it for myself, I would have put in at least one sex scene! </p>
<p> Rob Reiner, who made Stůj při mně (1986), is one of the bravest, smartest filmmakers I have ever met, and I'm proud of my association with him. I am also mused to note that the company Mr. Reiner formed following the success of "Stand By Me" is Castle Rock Productions . . . a name with which many of my longtime readers will be familiar. </p>
<p> If you don't have the time to read, you don't have the time or the tools to write. </p>
<p> Like anything else that happens on its own, the act of writing is beyond currency. Money is great stuff to have, but when it comes to the act of creation, the best thing is not to think of money too much. It constipates the whole process. </p>
<p> I love the movies, and when I go to see a movie that's been made from one of my books, I know that it isn't going to be exactly like my novel because a lot of other people have interpreted it. But I also know it has an idea that I'll like because that idea occurred to me, and I spent a year, or a year and a half of my life working on it. </p>
<p> I know writers who claim not to read their notices, or not to be hurt by the bad ones if they do, and I actually believe two of these individuals. I'm one of the other kind - I obsess over the possibility of bad reviews and brood over them when they come. But they don't get me down for long; I just kill a few children and old ladies, and then I'm right as a trivet again. </p>
<p> If you wrote something for which someone sent you a check, if you cashed the check and it didn't bounce, and if you then paid the light bill with the money, I consider you talented. </p>
<p> Talent is cheaper than table salt. What separates the talented individual from the successful one is a lot of hard work. </p>
<p> I've had a deal for years with Castle Rock Entertainment that goes back to Stůj při mně (1986). I have told them that you can have my work for a buck. What I want from you is script approval, director approval, cast approval, and I want to have the authority to push the stop button at any point regardless of how much money you [the production company] have invested, because none of the money you have put in has gone into my pocket. What I get on the back end, if things work out, is 5% from dollar one. </p>
<p> Books and movies are like apples and oranges. They both are fruit but taste completely different. </p>
<p> [on directing Vzpoura strojů (1986)] I didn't get the job because I went to film school. I got the job because I'm Stephen King. If you become famous enough, they'll let you hang yourself in Times Square with live TV coverage. </p>
<p> [on film adaptations of his work] I don't feel any urge to control after I sign a piece of paper. I say, "See you later. You have what you need and I have what I want. As long as the check doesn't bounce, you and I are quits." </p>
<p> [from his acceptance speech for the National Book Foundation's Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, 2003] I salute the National Book Foundation Board, who took a huge risk in giving this award to a man many people see as a rich hack. </p>
<p> I know a few writers who claim not to read reviews, and I actually believe one of these individuals. I am the opposite: I anticipate bad reviews and brood over them when they come. But then I just kill a few children and old ladies and I'm right as a trivet again. </p>
<p> [on the death of Michael Jackson] Strange man. Lost man. And not unique in his passing. Like James Dean, Elvis Presley, Kurt Cobain, Heath Ledger, and a dozen others we could name, he just left the building far too soon. Because, man oh man, that guy could dance. </p>
<p> I didn't believe there was justification for going into the war in Iraq. And it just seemed at the time, that in the wake of 9/11, the [George W. Bush] Administration was like this angry kid walking down the street who couldn't find whoever sucker-punched him, and so turned around and punched the first likely suspect. Sometimes the sublimely wrong people can be in power at a time when you really need the right people. </p>
<p> When Robert Bloch died, the only thing that anybody really remembered about him was that he wrote Psycho (1960), which became the famous Alfred Hitchcock movie. And whenever I'm introduced, I'm the guy that wrote "The Stand". When my name comes up in the blogs these days, it's usually in relation to H1N1: "He was the guy who thought about the flu!" </p>
<p> You can still reconcile the idea that things are not necessarily going to go well without falling back on platitudes like "God has a plan" and "This is for the greater good." </p>
<p> I'm in the supermarket one day with my cart, and there's this woman, about 95. She says, 'I know who you are. You write those stories, those awful horror stories . . . I don't like that. I like uplifting movies like that 'Shawshank Redemption'. So I said, 'I wrote that.' And she said, 'No, you didn't.' And that was it. Talk about surreal. I went to myself, for a minute, 'It's not very much like my other stuff. Maybe I didn't write it!' </p>
<p> (About seeing Carrie (1976) for the first time) In the row in front of us there were two huge African-American men. Two-hundred and fifty pounders at least. They're screaming like children. They're grabbing each other around the neck and one of them says to the other one, "That's it, that's it. She ain't never gonna be right". And I looked at my wife and I said this movie's gonna be huge. </p>
<p> Harry Potter is about confronting fears, finding inner strength, and doing what is right in the face of adversity. Twilight is how important it is to have a boyfriend. </p>
<p> I was addicted for most of the 80s. Its not a terribly long time to be an addict, but it lasted longer than WW2. </p>
<p> [why he disliked Jack Nicholson in Osvícení (1980)] Jack Torrance as written was someone who was a nice guy that then went over the edge, not someone who flew the cuckoo's nest from the outset. There was no moral struggle at all. </p>
<p> Having kids allows you to finish off your own childhood, but from a more mature perspective. </p>
<p> Never let the facts get in the way of a good story. </p>
<p> Never write a book whose manuscript is bigger than your own head. </p>
<p> You have to be a little nuts to be a writer because you have to imagine world's that aren't there. </p>
<p> A short story is like a stick of dynamite with a tiny fuse; you light and that's the end. </p>
<p> [his novel, The Stand] My "Lord of the Rings" of the American landscape. </p>
<p> [on cocaine] One snort, and it owned me body and soul. </p>
<p> Writing is the only thing I'm good at. I could never do another job. </p>
<p> Book tours are like a pillow fight with all the pillows treated with low-grade poison gas. </p>
<p> As a kid, I didn't talk much, I wrote. I'm not used to externalizing my thoughts other than on paper, which is typical of writers. </p>
<p> One of the reasons that I live in Bangor is because if somebody wants to get to me, they have to be really dedicated. </p>
<p> I'm the Big Mac of authors. </p>
<p> [on his past career as a teacher] Teaching school is like having jumper cables hooked to your ears, draining all the juice out of you. </p>
<p> You should do sex, never write about it. </p>
<p> People ask me when are you going to write something serious, but that's a question that hurts. That's like walking up to a Black man and asking how it feels to be a nigger. </p>
<p> [writing outside the horror genre] Writing on a non-supernatural level is like learning to talk after you've had a stroke. </p>
<p> [his religious beliefs] I've always believed in God. I also think that the capacity to believe is the sort of thing that either comes as part of your equipment, or at some point in your life when you're in a position where you actually need help from a power greater than yourself. You simply make an agreement to believe in God because it will make your life easier and richer to believe than not to believe. So I choose to believe. </p>
<p> [on his fear of the number 13] The number 13 never fails to trace that old icy finger up and down my spine. When I'm writing, I'll never stop work if the page number is 13 or a multiple of 13; I'll just keep on typing till I get to a safe number. I always take the last two steps on my back stairs as one, making 13 into 12. There were after all 13 steps on the English gallows up until 1900 or so. When I'm reading, I won't stop on page 94, 193, or 382, since the sums of these numbers add up to 13. </p>
<p> All those addictive substances are part of the bad side of what we do. Writing is an addiction for me. Even when its not going well, if I don't do it, the fact that I'm not doing it nags at me. </p>
<p> I have nightmares when I'm not working. What doesn't come out on the page just comes out some other way. </p>
<p> My brains used to work better. I wrote something last week and I looked at it the other day and thought it familiar, so I went back 100 pages and found I had duplicated myself. Paging Dr Alzheimer. </p>
<p> I'm the hood ornament of the Remainders. </p>
<p> Good work gets better when its read aloud, and bad work is mercilessly exposed. Its like shining a strong light on facial structure. Even good makeup won't hide bad writing. </p>
<p> Give away a dime for every dollar you make, because if you don't, the government's gonna take it. </p>
<p> There's always a market for shit. Just look at Jeffrey Archer. He writes like old people fuck. </p>
<p> I'm never sure why people are interested in my life when there are more interesting people in the world. </p>
<p> The appeal of horror has always been consistent. People like to slow down and look at the accident. That's the bottom line. </p>
<p> The day that I deny my identity, the day I'm not who I say I am, is the day I quit the business forever. Close up shop, turn off the word processor, and never write another word. Because if the price of what you do is a loss of your identity, its time to stop. </p>
<p> Charity begins at home. </p>
<p> My writing is more effective now I'm sober, and I feel more creative. I went through a period where I felt a bit flat, like a cup of Seltzer water where all the bubbles have departed. But now I feel like myself again, only with wrinkles. </p>
<p> The worst advice I've ever received is don't listen to the critics. I think you should, because sometimes they're telling you something is broken that you can fix. None of us like critics, but if they're saying something's a piece of shit, they're right. </p>
<p> I'm afraid of everything. </p>
<p> I have a permanent address in the people's republic of paranoia. </p>
<p> [on his fear of flying] The flight you have to be afraid of is the flight where there's nobody on who's afraid of flying. </p>
<p> [why he likes having peripheral vision] The part I want to keep, as a man and as a writer, is what I see out of the corners. </p>
<p> [about retiring] You know how when you're on the turnpike on a hot day, and you always seem to see water at the horizon? That's my year off, right there! Whenever I get there, its always a little further along. </p>
<p> [about On Writing] Its like the town whore trying to teach women how to behave. </p>
<p> When asked why am I so prolific, I say it's because I'm not dead or divorced. </p>
<p> [Neil] Gaiman is simply put, a treasure-house of story, and we're lucky to have him. </p>
<p> Making people believe the unbelievable is no trick; it's work... Belief and reader absorption come in the details: An overturned tricycle in the gutter of an abandoned neighborhood can stand for everything. </p>
<p> Once you get to a certain age you've got to try expanding your field. You've got to try new things, and if you don't you tend to get conservative. I always say you dig yourself a rut and then you furnish it. </p>
<p> I can't think of any books right now that would be comparable to Vymítač ďábla (1973). </p>
<p> I believe everyone is mentally ill. All people angrily screw up their faces like children or talk to themselves when they think nobody's looking. </p>
<p> Any one who thought high school was the best time of their life is totally fucked up. </p>
<p> I get my ideas from everywhere. But what all of my ideas boil down to is seeing maybe one thing, but in a lot of cases it's seeing two things and having them come together in some new and interesting way, and then adding the question 'What if?' 'What if' is always the key question. </p>
<p> I'm writing but I'm writing at a much slower pace than previously and I think that if I come up with something really, really good, I would be perfectly willing to publish it because that still feels like the final act of the creative process, publishing it so people can read it and you can get feedback and people can talk about it with each other and with you, the writer, but the force of my invention has slowed down a lot over the years and that's as it should be. I'm not a kid of 25 anymore and I'm not a young middle-aged man of 35 anymore-I have grandchildren and I have a lot of things to do besides writing and that in and of itself is a wonderful thing but writing is still a big, important part of my life and of everyday. </p>
<p> [on why he became a writer] The answer to that is fairly simple - there was nothing else I was made to do. I was made to write stories and I love to write stories. That's why I do it. I really can't imagine doing anything else and I can't imagine not doing what I do. </p>
<p> If you are not careful and diligent about defending the right of your children to read, there won't be much left, especially at the junior-high level where kids really begin to develop a lively life of the mind, but books about heroic boys who come off the bench to hit home runs in the bottom of the ninth and shy girls with good personalities who finally get that big prom date with the boy of their dreams. Is this what you want for your kids, keeping in mind that controversy and surprise -- sometimes even shock -- are often the whetstone on which young minds are sharpened? </p>
<p> Why can't a story just be a story? </p>
<p> Monsters are real, and ghosts are real too. They live inside us - and sometimes they win. </p>
<p> If you look too closely you might see something you don't like. </p>
<p> The Shining is one of those novels people always mention (along with Salem's Lot, Pet Semetary, and It) when they talk about which of my books really scared the bejesus out of them. </p>
<p> [Doctor Sleep, his sequel to The Shining] The true history of the Torrance family. </p>
<p> [alcoholics trying to get by without AA] White-knuckle sobriety. </p>
<p> I like to think I'm still pretty good at what I do, but nothing can live up to the memory of a good scare, and I mean nothing, especially if administered to one who is young and impressionable. </p>
<p> [Tennessee in the Civil War] The right side. </p>
<p> A lot of people did serve in the Civil War. </p>
<p> [not wanting to be a slave] Its good. Something to be proud of. </p>
<p> It's interesting to me to know that I have Southern roots. I had no idea. No idea of that. </p>
<p> [finding out Tennessee was a huge slave state] I didn't know that. </p>
<p> [while writing Doctor Sleep] I didn't know what was gonna happen. I never know. </p>
<p> I have a short leash when people ask where I come from. </p>
<p> I'll never be able to play like Keith Richards, but I always did my best. I always had a blast. </p>
<p> I grew up interested in nightmares, scary stories and things that go bump in the night. </p>
<p> I've always been curious about what my past was. </p>
<p> [slaves] They didn't like it on a moral basis. </p>
<p> [when discovering his roots] Thankyou. </p>
<p> [discovering your roots] I'm set back on my heels by this whole process. Like having a stage and turning on different lights so you see things you never saw before. It's a lot to contemplate. </p>
<p> [after learning new things about his heritage] Wow. </p>
<p> [after a DNA test] I'm 99% European, baby! </p>
<p> Information always leads to more questions, where you say to yourself yes but I want to know. </p>
<p> [the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918] It could almost be out of a horror novel that I wrote. </p>
<p> [his children Owen, Joe and Rachel] They're good kids. </p>
<p> [his real surname Pollock] Doesn't have the same ring to it. </p>
<p> I always thought to myself you look like an Irishman and you've got the Irish imagination. I've always had that appreciation for fairies and ogres and boggarts. </p>
<p> [from his dedication in his novel Doctor Sleep] My wife also read Doctor Sleep and helped to make it better. I love you, Tabitha. Thanks to you guys and girls who read my stuff, too. May you have long days and pleasant nights. Let me close with a word of caution: when you're on the turnpikes and freeways of America, watch out for those Winnebagos and Bounders. You never know who might be inside. Or what. </p>
<p> [on Psycho (1960)] They remember the first time they experienced Janet Leigh, and no remake or sequel can do that moment when the curtain is pulled back and the knife starts to do its work. </p>
<p> [syrup] Soothing. </p>
<p> People change. The man who wrote Doctor Sleep is very different from the well-meaning alcoholic who wrote The Shining, but both remain interested in the same thing: telling a kickass story. I enjoyed finding Danny Torrance again and following his adventures. I hope you did too. If that's the case, Constant Reader, we're all good. </p>
<p> Frontispiece to "On Writing": Honesty is the Best Policy - Benjamin Franklin. Liars Prosper - Anonymous. </p>
<p> You can take my gun, but you will have to prise my book from my cold, dead hands. </p>

<p> Sometimes human places create inhuman monsters. </p>
<p> [observation, 2017] The news is real. The President is fake. </p>
<p> [on being approached by dying fans about how Dark Tower might end] I would have given both of these folks what they wanted - a summary of Roland's further adventures - if I could have done, but alas, I couldn't...

<p> Stephen King is a literary icon, a status he’s achieved by a) defining a genre; b) writing brilliantly; and c) being prolific. In other words, not only has Stephen King written some genius novels (and short stories, novellas, essays, and works of criticism), but he’s written a lot of them—51 novels to date, in fact, with number 52 coming up shortly. </p>
<p> Note, however, the use of the word “some” up there. While we’d argue that King has never written a bad novel, there’s certainly a spread between the good and the great and the best of the best. Of course, we don’t just love to read King’s books—we also love to reread them, and debate their merits, and compare them to one another. So without further ado, here’s how we see the novels of Stephen King—starting with the ones we respect, and ending with the ones we adore. (Note: we’ve ranked King’s short story collections separately; find that list here.) </p>
<p> King’s next novel is due out in September 2019, but it sounds like it has the potential to rank very highly on this list. We know it involves a strange and sinister institution where “special” children—children with extra-normal abilities like telepathy and telekinesis—are experimented upon like rats, and one such boy, Luke Ellis, who winds up a prisoner there after his parents are murdered. The children are watched over by the cruel, exacting director Mrs. Sigsby, who is eager to learn the secret behind harnessing the children’s gifts. Life at the Institute is hard, but nothing compared to the fear the kids feel at the idea they will one day “graduate” into the experiment’s “Back Half,” from which no one has ever returned. It sounds like this one brings back everything we loved about King’s ’80s hits Firestarter and It. In short, we can’t wait to visit The Institute. </p>
<p> King has been open about his past drug abuse and other issues, and admits he wrote this book while high as a kite. It shows. Oh lord, does it show. Somewhere under the heart-pounding, jittery self-loathing, there’s a fascinating germ of an idea—alien artifacts (including an entire spaceship) are compulsively unearthed by folks in a small town, with disastrous results—but the only term that really fits the final product is “hot mess.” Though an immanently readable hot mess. </p>
<p> There’s a term for a writer’s early work: juvenilia. This novel was King’s first, and was later published under the Bachman pseudonym. The story of a teenager who murders two teachers and takes a classroom of students hostage, it’s quite simply not very good in comparison to what followed, filled with the sort of overheated writing that young authors often engage in while thinking they’re being provocative. After a rash of shootings at schools, King pulled this book from distribution, and it’s hard to find these days—and not worth chasing down, save out of curiosity or super-fandom. </p>
<p> This messy novel reads like two separate stories merged together uncomfortably. In one, you have a realistic and brutal tale of an abused woman. In the other, there’s a magic painting that serves as a portal to another world. Even after the abused woman steps into said painting to flee her attacker, they never stop feeling like two separate stories. </p>
<p> We won’t say King phoned this one in (because that would be a bad pun), but it does almost read as a parody of his vintage work. From the flimsy premise—a mysterious pulse turns anyone caught speaking on a cell phone into a hungry, aggressive zombie—to the stiff dialogue, there’s not much to recommend here beyond some admittedly visceral thrills and the veiled references to The Dark Tower. </p>
<p> The mirror novel to Desperation is entertaining and has some moments of fantastic, chilling horror, but the premise (an autistic boy, assisted by the same evil entity that orchestrates the horrors of Desperation, gains the ability to alter reality in his neighborhood) wears thin by the end. What’s more, without the interesting parallels to its sister novel, The Regulators is much less interesting still. </p>
<p> King wrote this alien invasion story shortly after he survived his famous accident, and it reads like a journal kept by a man in immense pain (and on a lot of painkillers). It’s the sort of body horror that can be—and frequently is— effectively creepy, but the verisimilitude actually goes too far, until you feel like you’re reading King’s private pain journal. On top of that, the self-consciously gross and hilariously-named monsters (literally called “sh*t-weasels”) come off as silly rather than scary. The less said about the ill-advised film adaptation, the better. </p>
<p> This isn’t a bad novel—in fact, it’s pretty darn good. If another writer had published it, we’d look on it more fondly. But since it was written by King, you can’t help but notice that it’s in just about every way a retread of themes, motifs, and tics he’s explored before—and usually better. A good novel? Yep. A mediocre Stephen King novel? Double yep. </p>
<p> This is the story of a girl who gets lost in the woods with nothing but her portable radio, tuned to the Red Sox game. That’s it. As exposure and dehydration worsen her physically, she hallucinates a pretty horrific scenario, leading to a battle with the God of the Lost in which the terrifying creatures and events mirror the reality of her struggle to survive. It’s a slight story that now also suffers from being a bit dated—after all, Tom Gordon isn’t exactly a household name any more. </p>
<p> Use a high concept (a 1953 Buick Roadmaster abandoned at a gas station is not, in fact, a 1953 Buick Roadmaster, but some kind of doorway to another dimension that occasionally disgorges bizarre alien items or creatures) to tell a series of stories about it in a campfire/ghost story structure, and the result should be something great. While the individual stories are interesting, and the overall concept creepy, the lack of a definitive ending to it all undercuts the success of the novel. </p>
<p> Another story as flimsy as it is pleasant, Joyland is basically a toothless coming-of-age narrative with just a hint of a mystery. It’s an enjoyable read, but doesn’t really stick with you, good or bad. It just is. </p>
<p> Cujo has some great ideas, but is among the weakest of King’s earlier novels. While it sports his usual skill at depicting characters and setting, ultimately it’s a story trying to wring horror and tension from a rabid dog; while it’s well worth reading, it never quite leaps off the page the way some of King’s more successful books have. </p>
<p> Blaze is a tough one to rank. It’s well-written and often engaging, but ultimately, the story of a brain-damaged con artist who kidnaps a wealthy man’s baby for ransom then bonds with the child is kind of weightless. There’s nothing “wrong” with it, it’s just a story you forget almost immediately, which is something you can’t usually say about King’s work. </p>
<p> Your mileage will vary on this one. Some fans rank it much higher. Told as a long, rambling monologue by the title character, it’s impressive that King can maintain such a unique voice for so many pages, but rock-solid technique aside, the story—while not uninteresting—is slow as molasses. Some readers thrill to the immersive experience and the slow-burn mystery, but others find it hard rowing. </p>
<p> To say there was some excitement among King fans when a sequel to The Shining was announced would be an understatement. The book is actually less a sequel and more an update on the character of Danny Torrance—which is fine. Danny is more interesting as a supernaturally gifted adult than he was as a kid, but the antagonists are, in a word, weak. You might read “spiritual vampires” and think otherwise. You would be wrong. </p>
<p> The middle novel of King’s Mr. Mercedes trilogy is a pretty good procedural yarn that ties into the first novel in interesting ways, but then sets up the third book in a clunky, heavy-handed fashion. Te reason it’s not a few ticks higher on this list is mostly because King engages in some rare lazy plot work, making a few things happen simply because he needs them to in order for the plot to hang together. King almost never cheats, so it really hurts this one. </p>
<p> The story of an artist who loses an arm and gains the ability to affect events through his paintings, there is much to love in this lush and often frightening novel. But it’s also rambling and a bit overlong. A tighter edit would push it up this ranking. </p>
<p> When you’ve written as much as King, experiments are inevitable and laudable. This straightforward crime novel is an experiment that takes a decent if not particularly riveting story and ruins it, because it’s a mystery that is never resolved. According to King (and we believe him) that was the whole point, but while we give him credit for the artistic ambition, it renders the book frustrating. </p>
<p> Each chapter in this illustrated novel is a self-contained story that links with all the others to form the narrative. It’s a pretty straightforward werewolf story about a small town terrorized by one of the creatures, whose true identity is worked out by a wheelchair-bound boy—but it’s very well handled, and the unusual structure elevates it. </p>
<p> A truly underrated novel, and one of the few full-length novels King wrote that has absolutely zero supernatural or horror ingredients. It’s the story of a broken man served with an eminent domain buyout from the city, which intends to build a highway through his neighborhood, and his increasingly violent efforts to resist. It’s pretty intense novel, with a gut-punch of an epilogue, and has actually become more relevant as time has marched on. </p>
<p> There is some great stuff in this novel, centered on the widow of a brilliant novelist as she reflects on their relationship and private and unique language while dealing with the emergence of repressed memories and the very real threat of a super-fan stalker who goes from threatening to violent. While King’s rumination on the inner workings of a relationship is interesting, there’s far too much of it in here, and the supernatural aspects feel tacked on. That said, at its core, this is a very good story, and certainly one of the most unusual in King’s oeuvre. </p>
<p> An early novel published under the Bachman pseudonym, The Running Man depicts a dystopia centered on an insane gameshow—this time having the contestant hunted by professional assassins on live television. It’s one of the most action-packed of all King’s novels, more of a thriller with a fantastic premise than anything else—but it’s a tightly written, gripping sci-fi story that has aged very well. </p>
<p> King’s most recent novel tells the story of Castle Rock resident Scott Carey’s struggle against a mysterious affliction that sees him losing weight—but not mass—no matter what he does. The best of King’s work is deeply rooted in our common experiences as human beings, and this one puts a Bradbury-esque flair on the inevitible experience of aging and the necessity of accepting our ultimate, shared fate. It’s a character-focused work that lets King flex his storytelling strengths: well-drawn characters, settings so well-observed you feel like you can smell the air. It’s also possible the most hopeful book he’s ever written, which seems an odd thing to say about the master of horror. </p>
<p> King fans argue about this one a lot, but in many ways, it’s classic King. The premise is elevator pitch-ready (a town discovers that an impenetrable, invisible dome has suddenly appeared, cutting it off from the rest of the world), the characters are vividly imagined and (mostly) realistically drawn, and the payoff is one of the more clever and imaginative ones he’s ever engineered. </p>
<p> Another of King’s ambitious experiments was the simultaneous publication of Desperation (under his own name) and The Regulators (under the Bachman pseudonym), with the books telling stories set in parallel universes that share characters and other elements. Of the two, we rank Desperation much higher: the tight, claustrophobic atmosphere of its premise—people traveling a lonely highway are pulled over and kidnapped by a possessed police officer and imprisoned—is a creepy and effective. </p>
<p> The final book in the Mr. Mercedes trilogy nudges the story into the supernatural, as the serial killer Mr. Mercedes has acquired some limited mental abilities that allow him to manipulate people and objects from his coma-like state. It’s a genius move, elevating the story beyond its need to wrap up the story and tie off the loose ends. </p>
<p> King’s efforts to evolve as a writer have produced some great work. While Mr. Mercedes, the first of a trilogy of crime novels, isn’t perfect (some of the characterizations are a bit thin and clichéd, as if King were aping other crime novels or TV shows) it’s tense, pivoting on a serial killer (who opens the story by running down innocent people in a Mercedes, hence his moniker) who taunts a retired police detective with his plans to kill again and again. </p>
<p> Some of the best stories have very simple concepts. This one is razor-sharp: a writer finds that the pseudonym he’s been writing under has become much more real—and independent—than should be possible. And his dark half is doing terrible things. The psychological richness of this idea, especially considering King’s own history with pseudonyms, combined with the tightness of the writing put this one in the middle of the pack. </p>
<p> It’s only a slight exaggeration to suggest King can write an effective horror story in his sleep. His 50th novel is a good one, bolstered by his effortless characterization and world-building as he tells the story of small town Detective Ralph Anderson, who in the opening scenes arrests a popular little league coach named Terry Maitland for the horrifying murder of an 11-year old boy by Ralph Anderson. The evidence seems to prove the culprit is guilty beyond any doubt—but then, incontrovertible evidence arises that also seems to prove Maitland’s innocence. What starts as a mystery slow-burns into a classic King horror joint, spun up with some seriously surreal violence. It’s a wonderful fusion of King’s ’80s aesthetic with his twenty-teens police procedural phase. At yet, the monster at the center of it all, while horrifying, doesn’t match up to the best of King’s supernatural baddies. </p>
<p> When King and Straub wrote The Talisman, King’s multiverse was still more of a notion than a firm concept. Its sequel, however, ties Jack’s story of parallel universes firmly to King’s Dark Tower saga, as an adult Jack whose memories of his earlier adventures have been repressed slowly realizes a serial killer plaguing a small town is actually an agent of the Crimson King. Jack retains his rare ability to flip between universes, and must reluctantly take on the task of saving not just his own, but all of them. It’s a rare example of a sequel that updates and matures its characters, themes, and universe in equal measure. </p>
<p> Revival is one of King’s best recent efforts—a chilling and unique work of horror that hits all the right buttons. A beloved minister loses his faith and pursues experiments in “secret electricity” that enable him to heal almost any affliction (with terrible side effects). He creates an experiment in order to communicate with the afterlife—and comes to the awful realization that the afterlife is a hell in which enormous, ancient monsters enslave and torture all humans, no matter what kind of lives they led. It’s bleak, depressing, and a fantastic read. </p>
<p> Co-written with his son Owen, this 2017 novel supports a high-concept premise (women begin falling into a supernatural-like sleep, becoming cocooned in a gauzy material, and react violently to attempts to wake them) with a rock-solidly realistic world to support it. The key to many of King’s best ideas is the futility of fighting against forces you have no control over; in this case, the women’s efforts to stay awake indefinitely has that rough-edge of pure terror that propels this novel into the top-half of King’s work. </p>
<p> If you stop to think about it, it’s remarkable King could take a hoary old premise like “haunted car goes on killing spree” and somehow generate a thoughtfully scary novel from it—but Christine is so much more than the sum of its parts. Tapping into the excruciating pain of being gross and unpopular in high school, King transforms adolescent rage into a universally horrifying experience. </p>
<p> The first part of this story (billed a bit presumptuously as “the last Castle Rock story“) is just King gleefully turning the crank, bringing the tension to an almost unbearable level before unleashing hell. A simple concept—a magical store where your darkest desires can be acquired, for a hidden and terrifying price—is elevated into a commentary on humanity, society, and the craven nature of people’s inner lives. When it’s casually parodied on Rick and Morty, you know you’ve written an all-time classic. </p>
<p> Another choice that will likely spark some arguments, Gerald’s Game is one of King’s least supernatural horror stories, finding its terror in helplessness. The genius comes in the levels of helplessness King explores, ranging from the helpless sense of being trapped in a relationship, to the helplessness experienced by victims of child abuse, to the literal helplessness of being tied to a bed in a remote, deserted location. There’s a reason this book inspired one of the best King film adaptations of all time. </p>
<p> Another Bachman Book, the premise for this thriller is so sharp and simple you can sum it up in one elevator pitch-ready sentence: a selfish, overweight man kills a gypsy woman and escapes justice, but is cursed by her father to grow ever thinner, no matter how much he eats. That’s it. It’s that simple. As the man steadily loses weight, his desperation grows to frightening levels. The richness of this plot, full of dark symbolism for modern-day America, remains powerful—and the blackly comic ending still packs a punch. </p>
<p> King himself regards the novel as something of a failure, but there are two reasons we rank this one, which is about a man who loses the ability to sleep and starts experiencing strange visions that might be more than simple hallucinations, so highly. One, Insomnia is inextricably linked to The Dark Tower series, and could even be regarded as an essential part of it, in a sense—it features the first mention of the Crimson King, in fact. Two, it’s a daring and ambitious story, exploring some of King’s most stunning concepts with a real emotional punch, and a classic King premise involving a character who loses control of their own body. </p>
<p> You know your writing career is going well when you’re forced to invent a secret identity in order to publish all the books you’re writing. The Long Walk, another one of the infamous Bachman Books, was The Hunger Games before The Hunger Games, except reduced to its most brutal basics—a group of young people are forced to walk until all but one of them is dead. It remains a surprisingly effective dystopian thriller. </p>
<p> While King is still often described as a “horror writer,” he’s been exploring other types of stories throughout his career. In this fantasy, King shows that he can craft a devious plot using any tropes at hand, and displays the same sort of worldbuilding prowess that has made The Dark Tower books so powerful. </p>
<p> Another transporting fantasy entry. Many of King’s stories involve children; the limited agency and mystification with adult concerns enhances the terror of his bogeymen and grants a level of verisimilitude to some of his more fanciful concepts. Co-written with Peter Straub, this story of parallel universes, which can be traversed if your twin in the other universe has died, centers on 12 year-old Jack. Jack seeks to cure his mother’s terminal cancer by locating a magical talisman, leading him through several dark and dangerous adventures that add up to one of King’s most satisfying stories, though the blatant homophobia throughout does dull its sheen, three decades on. </p>
<p> Ultimately, many of King’s best stories deal with primal forces, forces that are so terrifying in part because we can’t control them. Nothing is more primal than a child’s simple view of the world, when coupled with her immature impulse control—especially when that child has the power to set just about anything on fire with her mind. This one gets overlooked even by long-time fans, but a reread will remind you of its unadorned storytelling genius. </p>
<p> One of King’s greatest strengths as a writer is his ability to zero in on fundamental human experiences—like the loss of a beloved pet, the powerful yearning we all experience when we lose any creature that we care for, the state of fear parents live in for their children’s safety. What would you do to bring something—or someone—back? King asks that question and then offers a story that could have been kind of silly, but makes it absolutely terrifying when the magical titular spot does indeed bring the dead back to life—except different. </p>
<p> One of the most successful of a string of King “publishing experiments,” The Green Mile was originally released as a “serial novel” in six installments. It’s the story of a mountainous, simple-minded black man named John Coffey, who in 1932 arrives on death row at a penitentiary nicknamed the Green Mile, having been convicted of murdering two white girls. King masterfully mixes issues of race, sadism, and mercy into the story as Coffey’s innocence becomes clear in parallel to the realization among some of the more compassionate guards that he has incredible empathetic and healing powers. </p>
<p> King is the consummate artist who respects what came before and builds on it. Raised on old-school vampire stories, his take on the story incorporates all the classic tropes, from the slightly insane vampire’s assistant to all the old rules involving sunlight, permission to enter, and seduction—and gives them all a modern twist that still feels fresh and frightening, even four decades after its publication. </p>
<p> King’s career is so long, he’s been through several phases, like any artist. 11/22/63 is part of a late-career surge (still ongoing) of particularly strong, character-focused work. Time travel has been done so often in sci-fi it’s difficult to find a fresh angle, but King managed it using one of his trademark techniques: the inexplicable Mystery Spot located in a nondescript location. Tied to the Kennedy Assassination (still one of the most seismic events in U.S. history), the story morphs into a tragedy so subtly the reader barely understands why they find the ending so powerful. </p>
<p> King’s first huge success is a relatively simple story that touches every reader in a universal sore spot: the hell of adolescence. King shows his talent for identifying pain points and exaggerating them just enough to make them terrifying, from Carrie’s humorlessly religious mother to her effortlessly cruel peers, building up to that classic moment when a suffering girl with strange powers makes everyone regret how they’ve treated her. </p>
<p> The sheer scope of The Stand meant it was either going to be a tremendous success or a messy failure; not only does King offer up dozens of characters and settings, he tells an apocalyptic tale that starts off as a plague story and transforms into a biblical battle between good and evil. Even after he released the expanded version, replacing much of the material excised during the original editorial process, the story still hangs together perfectly, setting a multi-genre bar for success few writers could ever hope to clear. </p>
<p> If there’s a King novel that’s familiar to folks who don’t read King on the regular, it’s Misery, the story of a popular but conflicted writer who winds up in the clutches of his highly unstable biggest fan. Here, King perfected his technique of wringing true terror from scenarios that have nothing to do with vampires, ghosts, or ill-defined alien technologies—and everything to do with the fact that hell is other people. Crazed reader Annie Wilkes may be the most compelling villain he’s ever created, and that’s saying something. </p>
<p> King is at his strongest when his characters and story are rooted in a realistic world populated by regular folks—regular folks who just happen to be dealing with incredible circumstances. The Dead Zone, in which an unwilling psychic sees a terrifying vision involving an unstable politician, is the Platonic ideal of such books. As a bonus, it’s a surprisingly current book for the political present. </p>
<p> The eight novels that make up King’s multi-dimensional science fantasy epic vary a bit in quality, displaying a sag in the middle that’s surprisingly common for multi-book SFF series. But few would argue that the first three or four are mesmerizing, and the final book brings everything back to such a high level that the averaged score for the series, which tells the circular quest of the world’s last Gunslinger on a quest to reach the titular Dark Tower, the axis on which all worlds (including those depicted in many other Stephen King books) turn, puts it near the tippy-top of his massive oeuvre. </p>
<p> It can be surprisingly divisive, partially due to its epic length and partially due to a specific scene that was pointedly left out of the film and television adaptations (and thank goodness, because: gross). For our money, though, It is King tapping into the collective childhood terrors that we all share and generating a literary nightmare that finally made the world face it’s chief threat: clowns. That, and memorable characters and a palpable sense of place have made it a book that endures, and will continue to do so. </p>
<p> The Stephen King Top Ten could be argued up and down, but there’s little doubt that The Shining—his most parodied, most famous, twice-adapted novel—is always going to be a contender for the top slot. We rank it number one because it’s in many ways the ideal King novel, the novel scientists would create if they sought to grow a King novel in the lab. Every theme, flat-out terrifying moment, and character is 100% Stephen King working at the height of his powers. </p>

<p> Every Stephen King Movie, Ranked From Worst to Best </p>
<p> This story originally ran in 2017 and has been updated for the release of It Chapter Two. </p>
<p> Stephen King’s work has been adapted so many times — sometimes by King himself — that it’s impossible to find a single unifying thread in all of the film adaptations. Sure, a lot of them are horror (certainly a lot of the worst are horror), but that’s largely because the boom period for King movies was the 1980s, when he was known solely as a horror writer. As his canvas (and reputation) has expanded over the years, his work has been turned into dramas, comedies, musicals, and even a Bollywood movie. </p>
<p> Because of this dissonance, ranking King movies is particularly difficult: The Mangler and The Shawshank Redemption barely seem to exist on the same plane of dimensional existence, let alone on the same list of movies. Nonetheless, with the latest King adaptation, It Chapter Two, opening this week, we gave it the old college try. (For the purposes of this list, we looked at theatrical releases only, and excluded Lawnmower Man, an “adaptation” so vastly different from the original that King sued to get his name off it.) With one notable exception, you’ll find the adapted movies turned out much like King himself: They got more serious and substantial with age. </p>
<p> 42. Maximum Overdrive (1986). The one movie King ever directed, and … well, you know, Stephen King is a wonderful writer who should probably stick with writing. The movie’s tone is set in the opening scene, in which a man (played by King) tries to take money out of an ATM, and the ATM calls him an asshole. Apparently, a comet has passed by Earth and given mechanical objects sentience, and once they attack humanity, Emilio Estevez helps lead a human resistance. The movie isn’t even absurd enough to have fun with this lunatic premise, and King has zero skills as a director — visually, narratively, or in any other sense. King has called it the worst adaptation of any of his works, and we are not about to disagree. Though, according to King: “I was coked out of my mind all through its production, and I really didn’t know what I was doing.” </p>
<p> 41. The Mangler (1995). Of all the Stephen King adaptations, we must confess that this one has our favorite title. Boy, though, is this thing ridiculous. What, exactly, is “the Mangler,” you ask? Well, the Mangler is a demonically possessed … laundry press! This setup leads to hilarious scenes of an angry laundry press pressing up and down, like a hungry, hungry hippo. </p>
<p> Eventually the Mangler develops legs and starts chasing people. It’s all terrible, but, you never know, it might be your thing. Maybe you’re into laundry-press cosplay. You do you. </p>
<p> 40. Graveyard Shift (1990) </p>
<p> Graveyard Shift is as schlocky as low-budget horror films get. Its premise: Overnight workers at an abandoned-then-reopened textile mill keep dying, and no one can figure out why. Wanna guess why? We don’t want to give it away. All right, they’re being killed by … a giant bat! Because bats hunt at night, you see. (In the short story, it’s a giant rat. Bats are much more cinematic.) This movie looks like it was made for about $35, but it does feature a truly insane closing credits song. </p>
<p> 39. Riding the Bullet (2004). What was a thin, simple premise in King’s novella — widely considered the world’s first e-book, by the way, in 2000 — is extended to little effect in this drama about a man who tries to kill himself and then hitchhikes across the country to visit his dying mother. Director Mick Garris is an old King hired hand — he directed several of King’s straight-to-TV movies, including The Stand and the version of The Shining that had Steven Weber, of all people, in the Jack Nicholson role — and he tries to make this into something much more portentous and profound than it really is. </p>
<p> 38. Sleepwalkers (1992). It’s Mick Garris again (this was actually his first collaboration with King), hacking away at another King movie, this time with an original script from King. What are “Sleepwalkers,” you ask? According to the Stephen King Wiki, they’re “an ancient and forgotten nomadic race of vampiric shape-shifting werecats.” In the movie, they’re an incestuous mother and son who need to feed on virgin blood, and … well, you can probably guess where it goes from there. Amusingly, the Sleepwalkers cannot survive contact with simple house cats, which leads to all sorts of ridiculous scenes of our bad guy screaming in horror at the sight of Garfield. This movie is probably most famous for being terrible, but secondarily for having all sorts of horror-movie cameos, from King himself to Tobe Hooper to John Landis to Ron Perlman to Mark Hamill to Clive Barker to Joe Dante. </p>
<p> 37. Silver Bullet (1985). Considered faintly ridiculous when it came out, Silver Bullet looks even worse now; the special effects and creature makeup are bad even for a horror movie from 1985. Need proof? How’s this? </p>
<p> They really might have been better off just having a guy carry a mounted bear head around. You do have to admire a movie that casts Gary Busey as the doting, protective father … but only a little. </p>
<p> 36. Cell (2016). The second teaming-up of John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson in a King movie crashes and burns in a dumb cautionary tale about … well, about how cell phones are going to kill us all by sending a signal that turns us into murderous monsters. King wrote the book early enough (2006) in the age of portable technology that it seems helplessly dated by 2016. Our smartphones have come up with far more creative ways to kill us today. </p>
<p> 35. Dolan’s Cadillac (2009). This is not a documentary about a fancy American car belonging to the Knicks owner, though you have to admit it wouldn’t be that surprising to see that show up at MSG some summer afternoon. Instead, this is a slight, limp crime thriller starring Christian Slater and Wes Bentley — years before each faded star would make a comeback — based off an old King short story that even he had probably forgotten. The movie tries to be a grindhouse schlockfest, but can barely work up the energy. This got a brief theatrical release before zipping straight to video, and has only ever been brought up again in lists like this. </p>
<p> 34. Cat’s Eye (1985). This was made back when horror anthologies were all the rage, and King was at the center of them. The gimmick here: There’s one cat that connects all three stories, two based off Night Shift stories and one written for the film by King. The biggest star at the time was Drew Barrymore, fresh off not just E.T., but also Firestarter. But the best performance in the best vignette comes from James Woods, as a man who is so desperate to quit smoking he will try anything. The movie feels pretty dashed off, and it’s more reminiscent of The Twilight Zone’s whimsy than it is scary. But there is a cat. </p>
<p> 33. Needful Things (1993). You wouldn’t think a moral fable about a possibly demonic shop owner (played by Max von Sydow!) wreaking havoc on a sleepy small town, pursued by heroic sheriff Ed Harris, could possibly be bad — but, alas, it is. With a better director than Fraser Clarke “Son of Charlton” Heston, Von Sydow’s whimsical evil would have had menace and wit, but this plodding film has neither. How do you make Harris and Amanda Plummer boring? It’s really hard! Needful Things somehow finds a way. </p>
<p> 32. Creepshow 2 (1987). The sequel doesn’t feature George Romero behind the camera (though he did write the screenplay), but it’s still based on King stories — albeit lesser-known, less-fun ones than the original. None of these are as scary or as inventive as in the first film, though “The Raft” — in which horny teenagers get devoured by a creature from the deep lake in which they’re swimming — makes us squeamish still today. This one did poorly enough that it would be 20 years until they made another one, and neither Romero nor King were involved. </p>
<p> 31. The Night Flier (1997) </p>
<p> One thing King hasn’t written a lot about is journalism and media (at least, not until Twitter and the Donald Trump administration). He does try his hand at it with this adaptation of a short story about a schlock TV journalist (the late Miguel Ferrer) trying to track down a vampire. Ferrer’s actually pretty great in this — he’s a perfect seedy journalist — but the movie isn’t smart or sharp enough to do much with him. King has said that Ferrer’s character is the same “Richard Dees” who pops up as a shady journalist in The Dead Zone, for what that’s worth. </p>
<p> 30. Firestarter (1984). Drew Barrymore had her first post-E.T. starring role as a little girl who can set things on fire with her mind. Barrymore is able to make a mean-little-girl face with the best of them, even if the movie’s a little too dark and scary for an 8-year-old (much like Barrymore’s life at the time, actually). It’s also not great; King himself said it was one of the worst movies based on one of his books. Fun trivia: Firestarter was originally supposed to be directed by John Carpenter, but the studio rejected him because The Thing had flopped. This movie would have been a lot better if it had been directed by John Carpenter. By the way: This was the only time George C. Scott, Art Carney, Martin Sheen, and Heather Locklear would share a screen together. </p>
<p> 29. Dreamcatcher (2003). Otherwise known as “the movie where Lawrence Kasdan went off the rails,” Dreamcatcher had everything going for it, from Kasdan to a William Goldman/Kasdan script to Morgan Freeman and Thomas Jane and Timothy Olyphant. But the film is a total mess, start to finish: a mishmash of It and some military-thriller, monster-movie clichés culminating in a junky special-effects ending that barely makes sense. It is bizarre that people this smart and this talented made such a misfire. For what it’s worth, after this movie, there weren’t any big-budget studio King adaptations until The Dark Tower. </p>
<p> 28. The Dark Tower (2017). After years of false starts and, more recently, months of bad buzz, the long-anticipated adaptation of King’s beloved Dark Tower series proves to be kinda dull, in the most inoffensive way imaginable. Actually, that’s what’s most disappointing about the finished film: At least if it had been outright terrible, it might have been more memorable. We have no complaint with Idris Elba as the badass, square-jawed Gunslinger, who takes awkward teen Jake Chambers (Tom Taylor) under his wing, quickly realizing he has the power to destroy the Dark Tower and, consequently, the universe. But we have plenty of complaints with Matthew McConaughey, who plays the Man in Black as if he’s still doing his goddamn suave-mumbling-mystic routine from his terrible Lincoln ads. The Dark Tower has gotten the stamp of approval from King, and the movie has cheeky blink-and-you’ll-miss-‘em references to other King works like The Shining, 1408, and The Shawshank Redemption. But the film never really gets out of the blocks — it comes across as merely the vague notion of what an epic spectacle should look like, but without the audacity, vision, or soul of one. </p>
<p> 27. Pet Sematary (1989). Considered by some to be King’s scariest book, Pet Sematary becomes less of a queasy moral fable and more of a traditional horror, jump-scare picture in the hands of director Mary Lambert. King has never had much of an issue about putting kids in peril in his books — It is basically entirely about that — but it’s still a bit much to see a toddler being hit by a truck turn into such a pivotal plot point. Interestingly: This is, as far as we can tell, the only movie on this entire list to be directed by a woman, other than the remake of Carrie. (Coincidentally, Lambert was friends with the Ramones and got them to write the titular song for the closing credits.) </p>
<p> 26. The Dark Half (1993). Directed by George Romero during that brief period in the ‘80s when he wasn’t making zombie movies, this is one of King’s “nothing in the world is scarier than life as a writer” movies. (King came up with it after he stopped writing books as “Richard Bachman.”) Here, a writer (Timothy Hutton) uses a pen name to author a series of best-selling novels, but after he retires the name and “buries” the fake author, the name comes to life and tries to kill him. It’s a ridiculous premise that’s played weirdly straight, but it does feature a loopy, fun performance from Hutton, against type. Overall, it plays out as the thin idea it was on the page. </p>
<p> 25. Thinner (1996) </p>
<p> This Bachman book always had a fun premise: Rich, overweight, asshole lawyer runs over a gypsy woman, whose father then curses him to lose weight until he disappears. But the movie isn’t interested in any sort of moral tale, or in any sort of satire of capitalism — it just goes for the gross-out stuff. Imagine what David Cronenberg might have done with this. </p>
<p> 24. A Good Marriage (2014). Based off a 2010 short story King wrote that was inspired by Dennis Rader, the BTK killer, A Good Marriage stars Joan Allen as a wife who discovers, after 25 years of marriage, that her husband (Anthony LaPaglia) is a serial killer. Allen’s a tremendous, vastly underappreciated actress, and this movie gives her countless opportunities to showcase why. It’s still oddly muted, neither pulpy nor psychologically twisted enough to rise to a level much higher than a TV movie. Rader’s daughter, by the way, blasted King for exploiting her father’s victims by using their story as the basis for his story, and ultimately for this film. It was her first interview since Rader was arrested, and she noted that Rader was, in fact, a big fan of King’s writing. </p>
<p> 23. No Smoking (2007). Remember that segment in Cat’s Eye we were talking about earlier — the one in which James Woods plays a guy who goes to extreme lengths to quit smoking? Well, Indian filmmaker Anurag Kashyap made a whole Hindi movie about that concept. The movie does not directly credit King onscreen — though Kashyap has said King’s 1978 story “Quitters, Inc.” was the inspiration — and it ends in nearly the exact same fashion as the Woods story. The movie is hard to follow if you don’t already know the story and is considered one of the biggest disasters in Indian cinematic history. But it’s not that bad, really, and it’s ambitious in a way that the Indian film industry really wasn’t at the time, which might be why it received such a poor reception upon release. </p>
<p> 22. Cujo (1983). You have to admire the power that King had in the ‘80s: He could make a movie in which the happy ending is somebody shooting a dog. This is just your basic canine nightmare: Cute Saint Bernard gets bit by a rabid bat, goes insane, starts attacking and killing people. The movie isn’t any more complicated than that — though it does have “Who’s the Boss?” rug rat Danny Pintauro as the cute kid. Plus, there’s a scene in which Cujo is trying to knock over a car that is as viscerally frightening as it is utterly ridiculous. Imagine a nightmare Old Yeller. You could do worse. </p>
<p> 21. Hearts in Atlantis (2001). Okay, stick with us here: Hearts in Atlantis is a “loose” adaptation of a Dark Tower tie-in short story called “Low Men in Yellow Coats,” part of a larger collection about the baby-boomer generation titled Hearts in Atlantis, which also has a short story in it called “Hearts in Atlantis,” which has nothing to do with this movie adaptation. It’s very confusing. Anyway, Anthony Hopkins plays an old man with a mysterious power bonding with a preteen boy, played warmly by the late Anton Yelchin. It’s nice seeing Hopkins playing a relatively normal person, but the movie is too tame and respectful to explore some of its darker themes. </p>
<p> Theoretically, a modern-day, female-guided Carrie could have worked: Kimberly Peirce hadn’t made a bad movie yet, and she seemed to have the exact right perspective for what’s ultimately a horrific coming-of-age story. Alas, it doesn’t quite come to life, despite a solid performance by Chloë Grace Moretz in the lead role. (King wanted Lindsay Lohan!) The movie never quite places itself in its time and place; it feels like a remake of a ‘70s movie rather than its own thing. If anything, the film is a little too tasteful; it’s so afraid to be pulpy, it ends up not being much at all. </p>
<p> 19. It Chapter Two (2019). The primal, childhood terrors of the first film are replaced by much more pedestrian scares this time around, and a pumped-up cast — the presence of Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, and Bill Hader is a sign that the first film made a ton of money — can’t save this long-winded (it’s nearly three hours!), bloated sequel. The horror sequences are much more perfunctory and familiar than they were in Chapter One, and it really is a lot less fun watching adults be scared than it is kids. The movie may just have too much reverence for King canon to truly let itself run free. Fittingly, King remains a huge fan, and he even has a (sort of funny!) cameo in this one. But the highlight of the first film was Bill Skarsgård’s Pennywise, who gets the short straw in this one, paying sixth fiddle to his much duller adult co-stars. More kid terror, less adult angst, please. </p>
<p> 18. Secret Window (2004). Made in one of those last moments before Johnny Depp turned entirely into a cartoon, Secret Window is yet another King story about writer’s block, and it has more than a passing similarity to The Dark Half. This one has a darker ending than the book, in a way that has a nice Hitchcockian twist. But even in 2004, Depp was a little too twitchy an actor to play the Regular Writer Guy this movie needs him to be. </p>
<p> 17. Pet Sematary (2019). Maybe everything that dies someday comes back. Taking liberties with the source material, directors Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer have crafted a superior Pet Sematary to the 1989 version, for several reasons. The first is that this remake manages to be more consistently unnerving and mournful, really sinking its teeth into a dark fundamental truth: Even the most levelheaded of people simply cannot let go of the past or the loved ones they lose along the way. In addition, this Pet Sematary has a much better cast, led by Jason Clarke as a rock-steady patriarch who doesn’t believe in an afterlife until he discovers that his backyard is home to a cemetery that can resurrect the dead — sort of. And finally, it’s those twists on King’s book, which we won’t reveal, that allow the film to find its own creepy, despairing tone. Like too much modern horror, the remake indulges in lame jump scares and questionable plotting. But Kölsch and Widmyer weave some mighty fine mood, which means this good-enough adaptation is still miles better than most films devoted to King’s work. </p>
<p> 16. Children of the Corn (1984). It doesn’t hold up quite as well as you might remember it, but that’s probably for the best; for a certain generation of kids, “Malachai” was just about the scariest word in the English language. The movie’s a little more hackneyed and obvious now, but its central idea is still an undeniably creepy one: possessed children with pitchforks. This was based on a short story initially published in Penthouse (before Penthouse was the literary juggernaut it is now). </p>
<p> 15. Christine (1983). In case you forgot King was a baby boomer, here’s a whole movie about a boy who loves his 1958 Plymouth Fury so much that he doesn’t notice it has become sentient and is trying to kill him and everyone he loves — until it’s too late. The movie doesn’t quite realize it’s as silly as it is (John Carpenter directed, with a little bit less of a wink than usual), but that’s okay: You’ll be fully aware of it and probably have a dopey blast in spite of yourself. This seems destined for a remake with a self-driving Uber, doesn’t it? </p>
<p> 14. The Green Mile (1999) </p>
<p> If part of the secret to The Shawshank Redemption’s success was that it told an epic story with a scarcity of bombast, Frank Darabont’s follow-up film is where he starts to get a little too big for his britches. The Green Mile, with its three-hours-plus run time, might as well be exhibit A for Hollywood’s myriad overlong, self-important Oscar-bait dramas. And yet, if you can get past all that, this adaptation is surprisingly emotional and sensitively acted. Tom Hanks plays Paul, a death-row prison guard who treats his job with near-religious solemnity, and Oscar-nominee Michael Clarke Duncan is John Coffey, his newest inmate, who just so happens to have magical powers. To be sure, there is too much stuffed into The Green Mile — woozy ideas about redemption, an affected sense of awe — and as touching as Duncan’s portrayal of Coffey is, Darabont treats the character like a simplistic, irritatingly naïve beacon of goodness. (He’s in prison for murder, but don’t worry: He totally didn’t do it, removing any possibility of moral nuance.) Ultimately, what saves the movie is the cast and crew’s expert devotion to its polished, well-meaning hokum. </p>
<p> 13. Apt Pupil (1998). Probably the worst thing that could have happened to Apt Pupil was Bryan Singer choosing it as his follow-up to the massively successful The Usual Suspects. It set the film up to be something bigger than it was ever meant to be. What probably could have worked as a small chamber piece about a former Nazi war criminal (Ian McKellen) and the teenager (Brad Renfro) who discovers him is blown up a little larger than required. It was Singer’s passion project, and after it struggled at the box office, he made X-Men, the first of what would turn out to be six comic-book-superhero films. An argument could be made that he hasn’t challenged himself as much since. </p>
<p> 12. The Mist (2007). Frank Darabont ended his trilogy of King adaptations with this story of regular people trapped in a supermarket, fighting mysterious monsters from an enveloping mist. It’s much less sentimental and more horror-oriented than Darabont’s other films, but that works in its favor: It’s a lot less moony and self-important than those films, even if it’s not as good as either. There are some legitimate scares, and it has a terrific cast, including Thomas Jane, Marcia Gay Harden, Frances Sternhagen, and Andre Braugher. Other than Sausage Party, it’s the best film set almost entirely in a supermarket. </p>
<p> 11. Dolores Claiborne (1995). Kathy Bates says this, and not her crazed captor in Misery, is her greatest performance, and she’s pretty fantastic in this creepy, sad story of a family torn apart by a murder and the tumult behind it. There’s nothing supernatural in this story — just decades of pain and repressed memories bubbling up, with Bates as the title character and Jennifer Jason Leigh as her tortured, tormented daughter. The courtroom-thriller aspect of the film doesn’t work, but just about everything else does. It’s a better movie than you remember. </p>
<p> 10. The Running Man (1987) </p>
<p> Adapted from one of King’s Richard Bachman books — save for Thinner, the only one of the official Bachman Books canon to be made into a movie — The Running Man has almost no similarity to the novel at all. And thank goodness for that! Arnold Schwarzenegger is in full on ‘80s mode, to glorious effect, happily merging the silly and the grotesque — and it’s a blast. The movie has some real-life reality-show resonance today, but even if you ignore that, it’s just so much over-the-top fun that you won’t care either way. The real thrill comes from Richard Dawson, playing a nightmarish version of himself. It’s one of the greatest over-the-top villain performances of the ‘80s. Who loves you, and who do you love? </p>
<p> 9. 1408 (2007). The plot of 1408 is the simplest thing: John Cusack is a writer who specializes in the paranormal and insists on staying in a hotel room that has driven everyone who has ever stayed in it suicidally insane. And that’s all the movie is: Cusack sitting in that room, as reality slowly dissolves around him, going nuts in a way that only Cusack can. This makes for a genuinely unsettling thriller, directed with inventive weirdness by Swedish filmmaker Mikael Håfström. The movie has four different endings, but none of them are that satisfying; it’s the journey into madness that sells this one. </p>
<p> 8. It (2017). The 1990 mini-series had the space to encompass both halves of King’s epic tale of a group of friends in Derry, Maine, who do battle with the menacing Pennywise. But the Warner Bros. film sticks to the characters as outcast teens, whereas the planned sequel will flash-forward to when they’re adults once again confronting this spooky specter. Remarkably, though, director Andy Muschietti’s thriller doesn’t feel incomplete without the second segment, more than capably delivering enough scares and emotional resonance — not to mention an ending that leaves the door open for the next installment but also closes this chapter with real power. Jaeden Lieberher (so good in Midnight Special, and so much better than The Book of Henry deserved) is superb as Bill, who falls for the tomboy Beverly (a believably troubled Sophia Lillis), right as their small town starts being plagued by strange disappearances. Tim Curry’s portrayal of Pennywise was so iconic it was always going to be hard to top, but Bill Skarsgård’s performance is perhaps even more inhuman — and, therefore, even creepier. As an exploration and deft manipulation of the fears that adolescents face from a frightening, uncaring world, It has a fantastic psychological undercurrent to its horror scenes. (In this movie, your darkest anxieties are coming to kill you.) And anyone still on the fence about how goddamn unsettling clowns are will finally understand why the rest of us get the willies around them. </p>
<p> 7. Stand by Me (1986) </p>
<p> The first non-horror King adaptation is one of the quintessential 1980s hangout movies about guys being guys, working through their male bonding rituals. It’s also the only one with a dead body. Director Rob Reiner took his first step away from comedy to more dramatic fare with Stand by Me, and got remarkably lucky by casting young actors Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O’Connell as best buds who go in search of a corpse in the woods during the summer of 1959. Terror doesn’t await them — unless you count universal anxieties, such as puberty — and while the film is undeniably nostalgic for the unhurried drift of youth, it’s also pretty smart about how seemingly minor adventures become, in hindsight, defining moments in a life. For all its modest pleasures, Stand by Me justifies its inclusion of the classic Ben E. King title song: They’re both comforting declarations about the warm, unbreakable bonds of friendship. And, for what it’s worth, it’s the adaptation that Stephen King likes the most. </p>
<p> 6. Creepshow (1982). George Romero and King joined forces on the original horror anthology, a genuinely creepy, pulpy, and occasionally hilarious ode to old horror comics such as Tales From the Crypt and House of Mystery. One of these is dopey (“Father’s Day”); one of these is terrible but features an incredibly strange and oddly entertaining performance from King himself (“The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill”); one is good old monster-movie scary (“The Crate”); one is a true ‘80s relic (“Something to Tide You Over,” which features the amazing spectacle of Leslie Nielsen trying to kill Ted Danson); and one is still fantastic and skin-crawling today (“They’re Creeping Up on You,” with E. G. Marshall as a rich germophobe who will remind you quite a bit of our current president). It’s inconsistent, but still a load of fun. </p>
<p> 5. Misery (1990) </p>
<p> Nearly 30 years after Kathy Bates won the Oscar for her performance in Misery, it remains as surprising an occurrence as it did when the respected stage actress took to the podium to accept her prize, declaring, “I’d like to thank the Academy — I’ve been waiting a long time to say that.” That’s no knock on her remarkable portrayal — a perfect blend of menace and dark humor — but rather an acknowledgment that this isn’t the kind of role that usually gets accolades. Misery, a horror movie with a satiric streak, launched Bates’s film stardom. She’s fantastic as Annie Wilkes, the obsessive fan of Paul Sheldon (James Caan), a popular romance author who she holds prisoner in her home until he agrees to abandon his new manuscript — which she hates — and write something more to her liking. Annie could have been an easy, misogynistic monster, but in Bates’s hands, the character is turned into a complicated portrait of obsession, revealing the dangers of losing oneself in the work of others. Bates is frightening in her stillness, which makes Annie’s sudden bursts of violence all the more horrifying. But sneaky dark humor comes from the actress’s malicious glee at landing such a rich role. Annie may be a lunatic, but she’s also Paul’s comeuppance — a clever reminder that vain artists can be held captive by their need for stardom, sometimes literally. </p>
<p> 4. The Shawshank Redemption (1994). King has such a low opinion of so many of the bad movies made from his work, one assumes he’d be fond of Frank Darabont’s Best Picture–nominated version of the early-1980s novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. But King had his concerns about Darabont’s screenplay: “Oh, man, no chance they’re going to make a movie out of this puppy,” the author told the Huffington Post he remembered thinking. “It’s too talky. It’s great, but it’s too much talking.” King wasn’t wrong: The film is too talky. But guided by its deeply likable leads, The Shawshank Redemption warmly and (relatively) understatedly walks us through its Big Themes: friendship, empathy, and that moment when a man decides whether to get busy living or get busy dying. Darabont’s thoughtful character study sees incarceration as a metaphorical purgatory in which people find their true selves — a notion that has helped make The Shawshank Redemption a now-permanent fixture at the top of IMDb’s user-voted best films of all time. Not surprisingly, the movie’s rhapsodic online devotion has provoked an equally passionate backlash. Neither reaction does justice to this modest tearjerker, which, ironically, works best when it’s muted and contemplative. Hardly a masterpiece and certainly not a sappy, populist embarrassment, The Shawshank Redemption is simply a solid, good movie — an assessment that will probably annoy people in both camps. </p>
<p> 3. The Dead Zone (1983) </p>
<p> Perhaps the most underrated Stephen King movie and the most underrated David Cronenberg movie, this haunted thriller is basically the “would you go back in time to kill Hitler if you could?” premise, put on film. Christopher Walken is the doomed Johnny Smith, a schoolteacher who gains the ability to touch someone and see their future after a car-accident-induced coma. This uncanny ability leads him to a senatorial candidate (Martin Sheen — inspired casting), who Johnny learns will someday become president and blow up the world. Cronenberg gives the whole movie a funereal pall: a sense that sad things are going to happen to good people, but there’ll be a sad honor to it all. Real-world parallels between Sheen’s Greg Stillson (who hires goons and thugs to push an authoritarian regime) and current presidents aside, the movie holds up splendidly today, not least of all thanks to Walken, who is as likable and leading-man-handsome as he would ever be. It’s one of his best performances. Seek it out — it’s still great. </p>
<p> 2. Carrie (1976). King’s breakthrough as an author famously almost didn’t happen. While working on Carrie, the struggling writer tossed his initial few pages into the trash, ready to abandon the idea of a telekinetic teen, until his wife pulled them out of the garbage and insisted he keep going. Director Brian De Palma turned that book into one of the singular teen dramas — which just so happens to also be one of the great horror films. Sissy Spacek is superb as Carrie, a small-town gal as terrified about her budding womanhood as she is of her shaming, religious-zealot mother (Piper Laurie, practically demonic). People think of Carrie as being frightening but, until its murderous finale at the high-school dance, the movie’s dread has little to do with gore or body count. Rather, De Palma puts us into the paranoid mind of a young person, showing how her daily life is a waking nightmare that a lot of high-schoolers can recognize as their own: the pain of first love, the awkwardness of feeling like a weirdo, the strange changes in your body, the anxiety of figuring out popularity. Above all, Carrie is a beautifully calibrated, slowly escalating symphony of tension. By the time prom comes and Carrie sets her classmates aflame, it’s both a relief and a shock. In the wake of Columbine, films such as Elephant and We Need to Talk About Kevin wrestled with the reasons why kids take up arms to express their misery. But Carrie remains the most disturbing and sympathetic film about the hell inside so many teens. </p>
<p> 1. The Shining (1980) </p>
<p> Perversely, one of the reasons that The Shining is such a beloved horror film is that Stephen King hates it so. “I don’t get it,” he said in 2014 about the movie’s passionate fans. “But there are a lot of things that I don’t get. But obviously people absolutely love it, and they don’t understand why I don’t. The book is hot, and the movie is cold; the book ends in fire, and the movie in ice.” This is a large chunk of the movie’s appeal: Director Stanley Kubrick took the basic idea of King’s acclaimed novel and distorted it. Instead of a tragedy about a decent, flawed man who goes insane, we get Jack Nicholson’s pathetic Jack Torrance, a grandiose, pompous ass who dreams of literary glory, dragging his unhappy family to a remote ski lodge, resulting in bloodshed and agony. Kubrick’s film is a hell of a black comedy that satirizes the mediocrity of middle-class life: In the director’s world, fathers are pitiful providers, mothers are blandly cheerful (while quietly suffering enormously), and the kids see far more than their parents do. But by stripping the story down to its core elements — supernatural powers, madness, claustrophobia — Kubrick opened viewers’ minds to a treasure trove of possible interpretations, many of which were compiled in the wonderfully labyrinthine documentary Room 237. (Not surprisingly, King hates that movie, too.) But if Kubrick’s Shining is so cold, why, then, do we keep revisiting it and devouring its details, enraptured over and over again by its meticulous construction and elegant horror? Is it, just maybe, that it’s the only King adaptation that actually improves on the source material — giving us not just one way to look at the author’s masterful work, but two? </p>

<p> It by Stephen King </p>
<p> Rating 9.0/10 </p>
<p> An exploration of childhood, growing up, friendship and facing both real and supernatural fears </p>
<p> It, by Stephen King, was a book that impacted heavily upon my teenage years. It was at that time both the biggest - and the scariest - book I’d ever read and it is a book I remember most fondly. It is always a risk to revisit beloved books decades later - you’ve (hopefully) matured, which has both negatives and positives when it comes to re-reading, and like as not the revisited book is unable to pack the same punch it once did. And this was true of It, and also King’s other doorstopper, The Stand. They were both good reads but this time around I found issues and weaknesses that I gleefully missed and ignored when I was a teenager. Oh, how I miss being young... </p>
<p> It’s a book about childhood, in particular the special elements like friendships that seem they will last forever, days and lives that will last forever. I cannot think of many authors who can capture what it was like to be a kid better than King. He remembers things vividly and through his words allows us to remember the excitement, the awkwardness, the ability to laugh genuinely and hard at the dumbest of things. But it is not all fun, there are the bullies, there is the feeling of inadequacy and isolation. This is not just a horror story, indeed it is less about horror and more about coming of age. </p>
<p> As always with any book, you should focus on the positives first and foremost. As already mentioned, this is not simply a horror book, the scary moments are few and far between and all the more powerful for it. This is a book that allows us to relive the most potent time of our lives - our childhood. King’s narrative details the young and adult lives of Bill, Richie, Stan, Bev, Eddie and Mike (The Loser’s Club) and at the same time bring to life the cursed town of Derry. And to be honest the book’s colossal length of just shy of 1,200 pages does not feel that long, especially when you are within the chapters that capture your imagination and fears most. There is much of worth and value within the pages and nostalgia plays a large part in the reading enjoyment. You’ll like these kids, they will remind you of yourself and your childhood friends, and the fact that adult life rarely pans out the way you’d thought and hoped it might will resonate with the large majority of adult readers. </p>
<p> However, if you speak to readers who did not enjoy It their reservations often focus on the same two areas. Many say it’s too long and too detailed, often pointlessly so. But the main recurring objection to the book is the ending, which I have to admit slightly disappointed me all those years ago and this time around left me feeling rather uncomfortable. It’s not just that the denouement is a bit of a let-down (which I feel it is) it is those now infamous few pages in which 6 boys and 1 girl (all aged 11) have sex in the sewers. It is very difficult to explain why this happened and what Stephen King intended but now I am older, and a father, it is such a strange event to occur than I find it almost inexplicable. And for many it ruins the hundreds of pages of excellent story and characterisation that went before. </p>
<p> As an exploration of childhood, growing up, friendship and facing both real and supernatural fears I still hold It up as a great book. But the ending, and the book’s length in general, will be unpalatable to many readers. </p>
<p> Have you read It? </p>
<p> We've found that while readers like to know what we think of a book they find additional reader reviews a massive help in deciding if it is the right book for them. So if you have a spare moment, please tell us your thoughts by writing a reader's review. Thank you. </p>

<p> The span of emotions regarding this work by Stephan King is very interesting. I found the book a bit of a disappointment. Having read several of his books before and hearing great praise for IT, I downloaded the book with high hopes. The length of the book was an instant surprise, and as I later found out, a serious drawback. Yes, I belong to the group of readers who think that the book is loaded with much too many stories, narratives, characters and detail. So many that the names, places and times just get lost in the flood. Almost all of them are well written and interesting in their own right, but after a while, it becomes too much and irksome. Perhaps even more disappointing were the multiple climaxes at the end. So many things and characters that were endlessly built up throughout the book sort of fizzled out without much explanation, or detail, just when they were most expected. The list of characters in this respect is pretty long, but I won't mention them for sake of not spoiling things for new readers. I can't say I was shocked by the bit about the interaction between the children towards the end, but I truly don't get it, or why it was important. In summary, while I am not sorry I spent the time to read all of it, King has written better books. </p>

<p> Rick from United States </p>
<p> A long episodic novel, at times exciting, that mostly moved at a reasonable pace just enough to keep me engaged throughout. There were a few lags due to long winded details mixed with philosophical insights that I thought were fillers, but they were well written so I still felt captivated by King's command of the narrative. My only gripe was near the end when the kids did something that ruined the coming of age aspect of their epic adventure. I don't know what King was thinking when he'd decided to include this weird interplay between the kids; maybe he thought that upping the craziness and absurdity would satisfy readers' expectations and jolt them out of boredom, ensuring readers that the book would end without a controversial bang...but it didn't do anything for me other than feeling cheated, disappointed, and disgusted. For this reason, I thought it cheapened the novel and prevented it from becoming a true literary classic. </p>

<p> A fantastic book with a plethera of great characters, interesting scenes, and fantastic worldbuilding. For all the other bad reviews about "IT", the unneccesary parts you keep talking about is building up the world and characters, and was entertaining content nonetheless. He uses Jewish slurs and the N world to portray how it really was back in those times, as it was very common for them to be used. And for anyone who thinks they write "IT' in 500 pages or less and still have it be good, do it, and email me a copy, I'll give you a review. brandon.165885@nv.ccsd.net </p>

<p> This book is a real commitment. I just finished reading it, and I feel exhausted by it. I began it about 7 months ago and have been thoughtfully averaging about 50 pages a week. I give it 9 stars out of 10. I feel like I know this fictional town, and like I could draw a map of it. I'll miss it I think. </p>

<p> Tony from U.S.A </p>
<p> This book was by far the best book I have ever read. I just finished it and it is hard to let the characters go. Stephen King is a great writer! He leaves his audience in suspense and does not shy away from giving the full picture. I recommend it to all who enjoy fiction novels. It does have some heavy content. Amazing novel! </p>

<p> Alexander from United States </p>
<p> This book was just plain incredible. I didn't think I'd read all 1153 pages because I didn't like reading much anymore after school killed the joy of it. I just got the book because I had to get a book and I enjoyed the movie so I gave it a shot. Stephen King is an amazing writer, the amount of detail and characterization that goes on in this book kept me going. It did take me almost half a year though to read , since I procrastinate a lot. I enjoyed how the book took you from classic monster horrors that a child would dream up of like clowns, zombies, and spiders, to diving into all the real life horrors like racism, abuse, sickness, losing a loved one, homophobia, and just plain bullying. I love seeing the story unfold slowly learning along with the adults, what they did in the 50's and how they are gonna defeat the monster. Unlike others, I found the ending really satisfying but bittersweet. Would highly recommend picking up if you enjoyed the movie. </p>

<p> Katie from England </p>
<p> This book was extremely disappointing... Over half of this book was so unnecessary, added nothing and just bored the life out of me. 'IT' was something I was so hyped to read (due to the hype from others and my love for horror) and it started great with the death of georgie, then it was just boring. The timelines made no sense and I couldn't get into it at all. I wouldn't recommend this at all... </p>

<p> Diego from Panamá </p>
<p> This book is difficult to categorize in which age target is appropiate beacuse if you put for kids of 11 or 12 year old (as the main characthers of this book) the scences of the present part (in which the Loser's Club members are adults) have scences of sex and other things ,that the ones who read the book knows. But I think that teenagers and also kids (obviusly of 12 and 13 year old) should read this book because the lessons that they can carry carry off of this book and how the book results inspirational. The book have some errors as many of Stephen King books. For example: I feel that the reason of the members from Loser's Club to confront Pennywise are clonic, except Bill, who haved the most pragmatic reason to confront the clown, and the others feel like weak (but they compensate this with their tridimensionalitie and how realistic they are). Other error is that it feels kinf of convenient that Bill's father had knowledge of Derry's sewers and it feels much more convenient that he has not even asked his son what he would like to know. But the book in my opinion is an 8.5/10. Im not agree with the people who says that the book is bad because it has a slow narrative. I think that histories like these should have that hind of narrative because that help to develop the plot better and also have more time to introduce the characthers and know them. Pd: If some person notice a ortographic fault in my review, have mercy of mercy of me and im trying to learn english ;) </p>

<p> Sensational. I think you'll find those who say it holds too much unnecessary information and detail are the same type of people who expect instant gratification in life and hold little to no imagination of their own. This book is art. This book delves into childhood and brings up image's of a past we all had, one filled with wonder, fantasy and terrors of things unseen. Only here, the terror is real. Stephen King introduces us to a world where the main characters are are so fleshed out, you develop an attachment to each one as though you are part of their group and with all of them for every step. The ending left me quiet and feeling slightly less, as though I had just said goodbye to good friends. It reminded me of those times I visited my own childhood home and despite wishing to stay had to leave once again. The sex between the group. I think it's says more about those who are revolted than it says anything about King. It's sexuality for me, was non existant. This was a bonding amongst seven young people that surpassed the norm. An expression of true love between the group who had been brought together, who were meant to all together. And it also made the ending, the forgetting, even more sad. Depsite the horrors inside this story, it's a world I wish was real. Such is the ability of Stephen King, one of the greatest novelists who will continue to live through the ages long after we're gone. </p>

<p> I've just finished it and I miss the characters. I could see the light of the long summer days from when I was a kid (I was 11 years old in 1987, growing up in Poland). The book instantly brought back memories of how we played during summer holidays. To me, its not a horror story. It's a story about a lost childhood. How we grow up and forget all those beautiful moments and purple that used to be very important in our lives. How we can't even remember some of the names of our childhood friends. It reminds me a lot of Hearts In Atlantis, which I consider one of the most beautiful books about childhood I've ever read. I found parts where Mike Hanlon reports sightings of Pennywise from old Derry redundant. You won't miss anything off you skip those parts. I hated the real monster. It's kind of lazy of King to have gone in this direction. I also found the seed scene very weird and unsettling. Otherwise, a must-read. The ending clearly shows that it is a book about wonders of childhood and how growing up robs us of it. </p>

<p> Caroline from United States </p>
<p> I abosutely LOVED this book!! I already watched the movie prior to reading it and it was interesting to see how they are alike and different. This book was definitely one of the best and well written books I have read. I will say some parts go into a lot of detail and are kind of boring, but overall it gets really intense and I could never put it down! I fell in love with the characters ever since I watched the movie and I felt the same while reading the book. This book is not only horror but a story full of friendship, childhood, and love. 100000/10 recommend. </p>
<p> Honestly this book was a huge disappointment. I found it very hard to get into with a lot of in depth detail that just wasn’t needed. I found myself skipping huge chunks and after about 150 pages in I decided to just give this book up because I couldn’t see it actually going anywhere. This was such a let down as I was really looking forward to it after seeing the amazing reviews that are online :( </p>

<p> Mark from Australia </p>
<p> I got “It” for my birthday and, as l am not an avid reader, l found the 1300+ pages quite daunting. Overall, l did enjoy the book but, like other reviews in this forum, King included a lot of detail about characters, places and events that could have been reduced. Obviously he needed to portray Derry as a town which had a horrible and evil history. I found the child sex scene a bit off putting but again King was trying to explain the special bond this group had. I didn’t mind the ending and will now have to see the movie. </p>

<p> Galven from Australia </p>
<p> The story itself is great. The book is poorly written, sometimes bordering on incoherent. 3/4 of what is in the book is not necessary from a storyline point of view, and in my opinion is just needless fill that adds nothing to the overall story. The writing style puts me in a mind of something written by a teenager. </p>

<p> The problem with King's books is that you can't read them easily. In all senses. They are massive, contain a tremendous amount of characters, names, storylines etc. What can you find in "It"? A lot of kids, a lot of grown-ups, a lot of senseless dialogs, a lot of cruel and even vulgar scenes. And, of course, one diabolical clown. Are there any new ideas in the book? Maybe that one with the giant turtle who created our Universe because couldn't hold the gases inside her anymore? Well, I guess this idea would be just perfect for King because nothing more than that he can't make up. Unfortunately. </p>

<p> August Profumo from USA </p>
<p> It Book Review By August Profumo Its first victim was six year old George Denborogh. His (ten year old brother) Bill had built a paper boat and covered with hot wax, so that it could stay, dry and buoyant down the street during a stormy morning. George, who was wearing a yellow rain slicker with a hood and galoshes, chased it all the way down (splashing joyfully) from one side of the street to the other. But, when it suddenly shot down a storm drains’ mouth, he tried to snatch it with one arm while it was still swirling from vortices in the center, tantalizingly. But, IT tore his arm off—and he died of shock from losing too much blood. Then a few other children suffered similar fates, but IT always assumed the same form, a Clown with Orange pompons, aka Penny Wise. Then two gay men who were crossing their favorite bridge were assaulted in the Future by two anti-gay men. Then one hoodlum threw Adrian Mellon over the bridge, after using fists. Then he landed near a Storm drain, where IT a Clown lurked and then killed Mellon. So, the gay survivor’s attorney explained that, if he ever mentioned seeing the Clown, they’d lose the case. So, the Gay had to cover it up. So, currently the Derry Librarian (Mike Hanlon), who was a friend, called Bill on the phone and asked him to return to Derry since IT appeared to be happening again. It’s finely spun tale about a group of childhood friends that took an oath to return to their home (Derry, Main) to destroy, IT, since they had apparently failed as children. The group of seven friends struggles to overcome IT: a monster. When they were children, however, IT appeared to be a shape shifter: it automatically adapted its visage to coincide with the children’s greatest fear. Thus, IT appeared differently to everyone, according to the perceiver precepts. So, it looked like The Creature, The Werewolf, Frankenstein, The Mummy, a leper, a Giant Bird, or an Eye. This stems from watching horror movies at the Aladdin Theater with Bella Lugosi. Since this Period was 1958, a black and white TV was possible. So, when the friends were Adults IT, appeared to be two different types of giant spiders: One spiritual (eternal, dimensional or immortal), and the other mortal (flesh and blood that laid eggs). The friends must overcome both in order to triumph. The spiritual (IT) had to be defeated first before attempting to kill the body (IT). So, there were two separate battles. So, when the Turtle created the Universe (by accident), IT wasn’t included. So, IT had to create itself. The spiritual (IT) was sublime, courageous and cunning, thus, it was extremely tough to defeat. But, the body (IT) was bizarre, cowardly and naive and begged for its own survival and that of its spawn: one hundred eggs. It was trying to bargain. But, Ben crushed them all with his feet. It’s weaving back and forth superbly between when they were children and when they were Adults. So, you’ll be dying to read the next thread. A Vision for IT Bill and Ben had researched in the Library and concluded that since the Indians believed in Visions after being exposed to smoking logs in their lodges that they should try it. So, they gathered faggots and placed them inside their underground fort to ignite with matches later. Then Bill asked Beverly, if she’d be so kind as to not participate just in case they might have problems getting out. So, she could help. But, she asked everyone to draw lots from her matches, and even though, everyone drew fairly with a single match from her hand, ultimately, Bill ordered that everyone should participate including Beverly. Within a few hours, only Mike Hanlon and Richard Cozier remained within their smoking lodge—everyone else had driven out including their illustrious Leader: Bill. Then when they emerged—a few hours later—they were coughing slightly, but they were Ok. However, Bill asked them if they had had the desired vision—but they agreed that they had—and it was shared. IT hailed from outside the Earth (perhaps, from a different Universe). IT crashed over a million years ago and landed in Derry, Main. IT was eternal and a spiritual being. IT would sleep for about twenty-seven years, then awaken, and commence eating children’s bodies and souls. Bill discovers Silver when he comes back as an Adult When Bill revisited Derry as an Adult, he found his trusty old childhood bike again at a local store: Silver. So, he bought it. Then he called Mike Hanlon on the phone and asked if he could leave it there in his garage. He agreed. Then Bill had to walk it by propping its flat top tire up and balancing it on the bottom, precariously. So, he’s holding it up by its handle bars. Then he used two hands: one gripping the handle bars and the other the top flat tire. Then he walked forward a wee bit at time. So, when he arrived at Mike’s, he already had all of Bill’s tire kit gear and screw drivers ready (including a pump). Mike had bought everything about a month ago, and he had known why. Then Bill puts Silver on its seat and tests the wheels by spinning them a few times after finishing his repairs. Then he tightened some bolts and put a few more drops of 3-M gear oil on the chain. Then he beeps his horn, “Aaaauuuuuggguuuuuu.” Making a Dam Initially, Ben had a major scrape with three bad classmates who followed him from the Library to the Barrens where three children were building a dam: Eddie, Richey and Bill. (Ben had refused to allow their leader to copy from his Exam paper on the Last day of school). The Bad classmates had reaped havoc on their nascent dam by kicking it apart with their feet—and then stomping on it. But, when Ben arrived, he chucked a few stones furiously at them, driving them away—and the others friends assisted by throwing their own. So, Ben drew a side view diagram, with his notebook and pen, how to build a stronger Dam with wooden boards, supports, sand and gravel. Then they agreed to meet the next day to begin their new project. So, they started at 8am, Jun 4. But, their initial attempt had failed, so they had to pile a few more stones between the plywood planks. So, it took about three weeks. The dam was so successful that the local cop, Mr. Nell, told them that they had to take it down, since it caused the sewage lines to backup around town. He told them that if they tore it down (quickly) that he wouldn’t press charges. Beverly notices that her parents can’t see the blood in her bathroom She used the sink and toilet, but she saw a lot of blood suddenly gushing out of vents and spilling out, all over the floor. So, she had to clean it off herself with towels since her stomach, arms and legs were covered. So, she told her friends about it. So, the four boys: Eddie, Bill, Richey and Ben went to her house since her parents were gone for the day at work: her father was a Janitor and her mother was a waitress. But, they saw the mess. So, they helped her clean by buying new towels and then they took them to the local laundry mat to be cleaned. Beverley, remembered her parents having sex once with the bed springs crashing loudly up and down. Her friend explained to her about what she knew about it: “When the man finishes, he pees all over your bug.” Beverly as an adult was Living with her husband Tom who beat her up with his belt Beverly had married a successful business man who nevertheless beat her regularly with his own leather belt. Initially, he used it when he caught her smoking, since she had agreed to quit. But, once in awhile when she had received parking tickets, he’d hit her with it a few times. Then he’d say, “You’re going to get a Whipping!” just like his mother. But, Beverley believed that since her own father had hit her when she deserved it, that’s why she was submissive. But, when she told Tom that she’d be leaving for while in order to fulfill her prior commitments (although she didn’t say where) he went berserk. So, he went beyond the pale of a mere whipping with her. So, she retaliated in order keep to stay alive and to return to Derry, Main. After, escaping Beverly called her friend from a 7-11 from a pay phone and arranged to visit. Then she took a cab to her apartment and stayed there overnight, sleeping on the front room’s couch. Then the next morning, she explained what had happened—and her friend was a Pro-woman’s liberation type (like Rhoda Kellogg). So, her friend said, “You should’ve divorced your husband, Tom, years ago. Then she arranged for her plane’s departure to Derry, Main—and her friend dropped her off at the airport. Then Tom Visited Beverly’s Friend’s apartment and forced his way in—although initially she had dropped her guard for only a second. Then she was forced to reveal where Beverly had gone, because after beating her to a pulp the first time, he had threatened to kill her. So, Tom flew there. But, since he looked bad from his wife’s beating, the rental car agencies refused to rent him a car. So, Tom searched through the classified newspaper, searching for cars. Somehow, he found one, but he had to get the plates for it in the airport garage. Then he asked the seller via pay phone to drop a screw driver off to do it with, when he delivered the car to the airport. Then, when he arrived, he paid the kid $1,100 cash. The Refrigerator with Parasites in the Dump Beverley, had followed one Bad Guy to his favorite refrigerator in the Dump, where he kept a Zoo of half dead animals like cats, dogs, rats. Then when he opened the door, he was attacked by one Parasite type creature similar to a flying leech, with a huge proboscis, which poked a huge quarter inch in diameter hole in his arm, and started sucking his blood. So, he grabbed it with his free hand, squashing it dead. But, the blood that had oozed out of his wound on ground was his. Then another ten vile creatures emerged and attached themselves to him in the same revolting way, sucking all his blood out. Then, for the coup de grace, IT came by with a slightly different visage and dragged him off to eat. Then Beverly rejoins her friends and shows them what has happened to the Dump’s refrigerator. Then they followed her in order to ascertain, where the boy who was dragged off by IT, went. Then when they arrived within the vicinity, they saw a giant tunnel spiraling, downward. So, Beverly, who had her (Target) slingshot in her back pocket, pulled it out, and withdrew one of the two silver pellets from her front pocket, then aimed it, and finally shot at a creature that looked like a giant mosquito from hell. But, initially she had missed, but it had curved back magically and struck its target—making mince meat out of it—at the last second. The First Rock Fight Mike Hanlon was trying to escape from three bad classmates who had infiltrated by climbing over his fences and continued following him out. One claimed to have poisoned his dog. They hit each other with branches and pelted each other with small stones. So, they chased him to the Barrens wild country, where he was trying to shake them. That’s where the friends were, in their own territory. So, they had had plenty of ammo: round sedimentary stones against their arch enemies who were pursuing, strategically cached in pits. So, they succeeded in defending themselves, admirably. So, from that day onward they allowed Mike Hanlon to become a member of The Losers Club. So, he agreed to keep their vital secrets. But, after talking with him, they discovered that some of their experiences were shared: IT. Then Mike showed his friends his father’s entire collection of photos from Derry without asking for his permission, which included the Clown, doing round-offs, flip-flops and double whip backs, as entertainment for the children and handing out orange helium filled balloons that floated in the opposite direction of the wind without casting any shadows. (Bill had seen similar revealing pictures from his father’s albums with his little brother, George). Mike had seen IT in person as well. The Black Spot Fire Mike was talking to his father at the hospital just before he died of Cancer and he was taking morphine to kill the pain. He told him about when he was in the Army and patronized local off base drinking establishments during (Carrie Nation’s) Prohibition on the weekends, which was merited because he had worked extremely hard during the week. He got in trouble for going because somehow it got back to the CO. So, they allowed the blacks on his base to build their own club there. After, we refurbished its floors with oil, it opened everyday at 11am but it was like a cafeteria serving only Soda pop and cheddar burgers with French fries. Then after a while, we had live Jazz music on Friday and Saturday nights from 5pm to 2am. Indeed, it was so popular that people would come from across the state line, stay and danced all night long but they brought their own booze inside brown paper bags (like Canadian Whisky). Then about six hooded gang members with white robes and masks drove there in a white van and exited. Then they lit their kerosene torches with matches and used them to ignite the building inside, mainly by throwing them through the kitchen window. The front door was wide open, but because that was the only way out, it got jammed shut during the first ten seconds, since there was a stampede (about 300 people panicked). Then I was able to escape by jumping through the kitchen window, but I had to be careful not to cut my hands with broken glass. Then the sergeant showed up, driving a heavy steak truck. Then he got out and started to give orders to my friend and me. So, my friend hit the sergeant’s head with his fist, knocking him out cold. Then he jumped into the truck and rammed it into the flaming building. The first time he hit, he got hurt, but when he hit it again by putting it in reverse. Then when he finally hit it full force, a small crack appeared and a few people were able to scuttle out, escaping with smoke trailing behind. But, some were still on fire, so I started throwing buckets of water or hitting them with wet towels in order to extinguish it. The Epilogue Then at the very End, Bills wife, Audra, who had survived the ordeal with IT—in the catacombs, attached to a cocoons’ spun like thread—was stricken with catatonia. But, she still hasn’t recovered fully—even though Bill has grown bald from aging. So, Bill gets Silver ready—his trusty old bike from his childhood days with Playing cards on its spokes held there by close-pins. Then he takes her for a ride. Then when he says,” Hi Oh, Silver, Away!” she finally wakes up from her catatonic state like a miracle. Then she warns him to stop or he’ll kill them both with his foolishness. Then Audra, said, “I remember getting off the plane at Bangor, and I can’t remember a thing after that.” Analysis King continues writing until he’s satisfied with his Endings. But, because he’s hot-rodder, he’s rolling along inexorably forward from his own momentum like a giant wheel. So, it’ll take a while for him to stop because his accrued momentum (from velocity and mass) is insurmountably massive. His descriptions are still remarkably detailed, vivid and refreshing from beginning to end. He’s thoroughly immersed in his topic because he identifies closely with each character for their sake. So, he sees their perspectives and understands it utterly. Then his explanations are honest, profound and outstanding. </p>

<p> Adam from Australia </p>
<p> This is a book that can shape your reading years as a child/teenager (I believe I was 10 when I first read IT) simply because it can reach out to those parts of your life that resonate most strongly with what the Loser's Club may experience away from the horror of IT. I have since read this novel several times since and while I can on occasion feel a bit impatient to reach critical points in the novel I also realize that those moments would not have the same impact without the time spent exploring the characters beforehand. I disagree with the comment about the length (which the above also mentions is not an issue for all) as I found that it created a complete journey for the main cast which may have been missed on a shorter page count. And also I was always surprised by the outrage about the scene where Beverly ties them all together during sex, to me it made sense in the situation of which it occurred given that they were trying to create a bond that would never be lost in the insanity they had witnessed and the lives ahead of them. I guess the purpose of this was in a sense that if they had not created some connection (and Stan's cutting of palms also follows) they would have never come back to end IT later on in their lives and what they had gone through as children would have accounted for nothing. </p>

<p> Stephen King Biography </p>
<p> Born: September 21, 1947 Portland, Maine American author </p>
<p> Stephen King is a very popular author of horror fiction. In his works he blends elements of the traditional gothic (bleak and threatening) tale with those of the modern psychological (how the mind works) thriller, detective, and science fiction stories. </p>
<p> His early years </p>
<p> Stephen Edwin King was born on September 21, 1947, in Portland, Maine. When he was two years old, his father left the family, leaving his mother to care for Stephen and his older brother, David. She took a series of low-paying jobs to support her children, and as a result the boys saw little of their mother. </p>
<p> As a boy King found a box of fantasyhorror fiction books and stories that had belonged to his father, and he read them all. By the time King was seven he had begun writing his own stories. He enjoyed watching science fiction and monster movies. </p>
<p> "Writing has always been it for me," King indicated in a panel discussion at the 1984 World Fantasy Convention in Ottawa, Canada. Science fiction and adventure stories comprised his first literary efforts. King began submitting short fiction to magazines when he was twelve. He had no success at that time selling his stories, but he did win first prize in an essay competition sponsored by a scholastic magazine. In high school King authored a small, satiric (poking fun at human weakness) newspaper entitled The Village Vomit. He published his first story at eighteen in a magazine called Comics Review. </p>
<p> King graduated from high school in 1966. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from the University of Maine in 1970. He married Tabitha Spruce, also a writer, the following year. They have three children. </p>
<p> After college </p>
<p> After graduating from college, King taught English at a high school in Maine and added to his income by holding a number of part-time jobs and by writing short stories for several popular magazines. He did not receive much money from the sale of his stories. Sometimes he was not paid at all but was given extra copies of the magazine to show or sell to other people. </p>
<p> King's first novel was Carrie, published in 1974. It was a huge success, which allowed King to quit his other jobs and write full-time. With this book, King became one of the top writers of horror stories. </p>
<p> Popularity </p>
<p> King's fiction features everyday language, attention to the details of the story's surroundings, the emotional feelings of his characters, realistic settings, and an emphasis on modern problems. King's popularity comes from his ability to create stories in which evil occurs in ordinary situations. </p>
<p> Many of King's stories are semiautobiographical, meaning that they are taken in part from some of his own experiences. Many of the locations he writes about are based on the places he grew up in when he lived in Maine and other locations. Many of his stories deal with ordinary people who are faced with frightening events they have to try to understand and overcome. </p>
<p> A publishing marvel, King has nearly one hundred million copies of his works in print worldwide. He is the first writer to have had three, four, and finally five titles appear simultaneously (at the same time) on the New York Times bestseller list. </p>
<p> How King approaches writing </p>
<p> Some of King's works are variations (different ways of telling) on classic stories of fantasy and horror. Salem's Lot, for example, is a contemporary (modern) version of Bram Stoker's (1847–1912) novel Dracula, set in an isolated New England town. King's epic (long </p>

<p> . </p>
<p> and large in scope) The Stand is close in structure to J. R. R. Tolkien's (1892–1973) Lord of The Rings. It tells of a battle between the forces of good and evil. </p>
<p> King used to write every day except for Christmas day, the Fourth of July, and his own birthday. Very often he would work on two or three stories at a time, switching from one to another as ideas came to him. </p>
<p> King has also admitted that during the period between 1977 and 1984 he wrote five novels under the pseudonym (a false name used to hide the identity of the writer) Richard Bachman. He did this to disguise the true extent of his prolific (abundant, in great quantity) work. Also, his publisher believed that he had already saturated (filled to capacity) the market. </p>
<p> Scary </p>
<p> In his stories King also likes to write about how people relate to one another in scary situations. His characters are taken from both young and older people who come from many different backgrounds. King has said that he just wants to scare people. He likes to frighten his readers after he has made them love his characters. While stressing the importance of characterization (describing the qualities of characters), he regards the story itself as the most essential part of crafting fiction. </p>
<p> Even though he is very successful, King is modest. In an interview with Yankee magazine he said, "I'm leery [cautious] of thinking I'm somebody. Because nobody really is. Everybody is able to do something well, but in this country there's a premium [special value] put on stardom." He also said there is an "occupational hazard" (a danger based on a job) in being a successful writer, because of all the attention a writer can receive. </p>
<p> The accident </p>
<p> King had his own personal experience with horror on the afternoon of June 19, 1999. As he was walking near his summer home in Bangor, Maine, he was struck by a van. King had many operations to repair a collapsed lung and multiple fractures (small breaks) to his leg and hip. He then spent many months recovering in the hospital. King did get well but did not regain the same state of health he had before the accident. </p>
<p> The driver who hit King claimed the dog in his van distracted him. It was found he had several driving violations (acts of breaking the law). He was fined, but he did not go to jail, nor was his driver's license taken away. </p>
<p> Movies, television, and the World Wide Web </p>
<p> Many of Stephen King's books and stories have been made into movies for both Hollywood and for television. These include Carrie, Salem's Lot, The Shining, Christine, The Shawshank Redemption, and The Green Mile. </p>
<p> In 2000 King's publisher, Simon & Schuster, published his novella (short novel) Riding the Bullet in electronic form. After that King became the first well-known author to self-publish on the Internet when he published several segments of a new book, The Plant, on the Web. In 2000 he also wrote On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft. In this book he tried to give advice to people who want to become writers based on his own experiences. </p>
<p> In early 2002 King announced his retirement from writing, saying that he has said everything that he set out to say. </p>
<p> Stephen King is regarded as a master of the horror story, developing this type of tale to a new level. The ideal format for horror tales used to be the short story, but King is one of the first to challenge that idea. He has written not just successful horror novels, but successful, long horror novels. His fans may take comfort in the fact that retirement is not always permanent. </p>

<p> Readers’ Poll: The 10 Best Stephen King Books </p>
<p> Your picks for the horror master’s scariest, most suspenseful page-turners, from ‘It’ to ‘The Dead Zone’ </p>
<p> In our recent interview with Stephen King, we asked the author to name the best book he ever wrote. Without a moment's hesitation he went with Lisey's Story, a 2006 novel about a woman coping with the death of her husband, who happened to be a best-selling author. We figured many of his fans would have a different choice, so we opened it up for a vote. Here are the results, but note that the vast number of Dark Tower books made it hard for any one of them to make a great showing on the list. </p>
<p> 10 </p>
<p> ‘The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass’ </p>
<p> Dark Tower mostly takes place in Mid-World, the decayed remains of a once great empire where a Gunslinger named Roland is attempting to reach the distant – titular – Dark Tower. The fourth book in the series was published in 1997, and it focuses largely on Roland's teenage years and his doomed love affair with Susan Delgado. It was the final Dark Tower book written before King's van accident, which inspired him to quickly finish the series by writing the last three books all in a row. To some fans, the final books felt a little rushed and anti-climactic, and they see book four as the best of the series. </p>

<p> People are often surprised that The Shawshank Redemption was adapted from a 1982 Stephen King novella: It goes against the general perception that he only writes horror books about killer clowns, haunted hotels and super viruses. But is there anything more terrifying than the prospect of being sentenced to life in jail for a crime you didn't commit? Throw in a sadistic warden and prison rapists, and you've got a living nightmare. In his novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, Andy Dufresne is short and his buddy Red is Irish, but Hollywood had a different idea for the characters. Originally, the adaptation bombed, but it has since become regarded as one of the most moving films of its time. </p>
<p> 8 </p>
<p> ‘The Dead Zone’ </p>
<p> King wrapped up his incredible run of 1970s books with The Dead Zone, the tale of Johnny Smith, a schoolteacher who awakens from a coma with psychic abilities. When he meets a deranged politician destined to become president he faces the horrible choice about whether or not he should assassinate him. It's a riveting story, and in 1983, it became a movie starring Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen. </p>
<p> 7 </p>
<p> ‘The Green Mile’ </p>
<p> King released his prison drama The Green Mile in six monthly installments in the spring and summer of 1993. It's the story of a large black man sentenced to death for the rape of two young girls. He's very timid and quiet, but he possesses the power to heal people with a touch. Some accused King of creating a "magical negro" character, but the writer strongly disagrees: "When I was writing the book I said to myself, 'What can I do to make sure that this character goes to the chair even if he's innocent?'" King says. "And I said, 'Well, it's 1933. If he's black, nobody is going to let him off the hook no matter what the evidence is. They're going to fry him.' So I made him a black guy." </p>
<p> 6 </p>
<p> ’11/22/63′ </p>
<p> King spent four decades considering the idea of a man who goes back in time to prevent JFK's assassination, and in 2011 he finally wrote the book about it. The result centers around a divorced high school teacher who finds a portal to 1958 in a small diner, taking a teaching job in a small town near Dallas as he prepares for the big day. It's absolutely brilliant, and the New York Times even called it one of the greatest books of the year. There's talk of turning it into a movie, but so far nobody has been able to boil down the 849-pager into a tight screenplay. </p>
<p> 5 </p>
<p> ‘Misery’ </p>
<p> Authors like King attract a lot of nutty fans, but thankfully, he's never dealt with anyone like Annie Wilkes, the deranged Misery character who kidnaps her favorite author and forces him to write a sequel to her favorite series. When the author fights back, Wilkes takes out an axe and starts chopping away at him. It's a disturbing book, and it wasn't until years later that King realized the whole thing was an elaborate metaphor for his raging cocaine addiction. "Misery is a book about cocaine," he recently told Rolling Stone. "Annie Wilkes is cocaine. She was my number-one fan." </p>
<p> 4 </p>
<p> ‘Salem’s Lot’ </p>
<p> After breaking big with his debut novel Carrie, King proved he wasn't a one-trick pony when he released the follow-up in 1975. Salem's Lot has a rather simple premise: What if a Dracula-like vampire moved to a small town in Maine? Slowly, much of the town transforms into vampires – until a high school teacher and his young girlfriend begin fighting back. For years King contemplated writing a sequel, but he decided to simply fold one of characters, Father Callahan, into the final Dark Tower books. </p>
<p> 3 </p>
<p> ‘The Shining’ </p>
<p> King and his young family moved to Colorado for a brief period in the mid-1970s, and when they were out there they spent a night at the historic Stanley Hotel in Estes Park. The place was about to close up for the winter, and King spent time wandering around the nearly empty building all by himself. He imagined would it be like spending the entire winter trapped inside, and the idea for The Shining came to him almost at once. At the time, he was struggling with a pretty bad drinking problem, and this became a major element of the plot. Stanley Kubrick adapted the story for the big screen in 1980, and it over time it has become a beloved classic – though King has been very vocal about his distaste for this version. </p>
<p> 2 </p>
<p> ‘It’ </p>
<p> King's 1986 novel It has caused more people to fear clowns than perhaps any movie, book or TV show in history. It's an epic story, spread across three decades, about a group of Maine friends that battle a demented clown named Pennywise who lives in their town's sewers. They think they kill him in the 1950s, but 30 years later they are forced to reunite for a final battle. At 1,142 pages, it's one of King's longest books, but many people find themselves reading it in a matter of days. </p>
<p> 1 </p>
<p> ‘The Stand’ </p>
<p> The original draft for The Stand was so long that printing presses were literally unable to handle it, forcing King to cut out a large chunk of the book, the story of a super virus called Captain Trips that wipes out about 99 percent of the planet. The survivors come together in two camps and wage the ultimate war of good against evil. It's a crazily ambitious book, but King executed it flawlessly. The uncut version came out in 1990, and four years later ABC turned it into a miniseries. There's been talk for years about a proper movie – or even a series of movies – but neither has yet to happen. </p>
<p> Stephen King Biography </p>
<p> Updated: </p>
<p> Sep 6, 2019 </p>
<p> Original: </p>
<p> Stephen King is a 'New York Times'-bestselling novelist who made his name in the horror and fantasy genres with books like 'Carrie,' 'The Shining' and 'IT.' Much of his work has been adapted for film and TV. </p>
<p> Who Is Stephen King? </p>
<p> Stephen King was born on September 21, 1947, in Portland, Maine. He graduated from the University of Maine and later worked as a teacher while establishing himself as a writer. Having also published work under the pseudonym Richard Bachman, King's first horror novel, Carrie, was a huge success. Over the years, King has become known for titles that are both commercially successful and sometimes critically acclaimed. His books have sold more than 350 million copies worldwide and been adapted into numerous successful films. </p>
<p> Early Life and Education </p>
<p> Author Stephen Edwin King was born on September 21, 1947, in Portland, Maine. King is recognized as one of the most famous and successful horror writers of all time. His parents, Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King, split up when he was very young, and he and his brother David divided their time between Indiana and Connecticut for several years. King later moved back to Maine with his mother and brother. There he graduated from Lisbon Falls High School in 1966. </p>
<p> King stayed close to home for college, attending the University of Maine at Orono. There he wrote for the school's newspaper and served in its student government. While in school, King published his first short story, which appeared in Startling Mystery Stories. After graduating with a degree in English in 1970, he tried to find a position as a teacher but had no luck at first. King took a job in a laundry and continued to write stories in his spare time until late 1971, when he began working as an English educator at Hampden Academy. It was that year that he also married fellow writer Tabitha Spruce. </p>
<p> King of Thrills and Chills </p>
<p> In 1973, King sold his first novel, Carrie, the tale of a tormented teen who gets revenge on her peers. The book became a huge success after it was published the following year, allowing him to devote himself to writing full time. It was later adapted for the big screen with Sissy Spacek as the title character. More popular novels soon followed, including Salem's Lot (1975), The Shining (1977), Firestarter (1980), Cujo (1981) and IT (1986). </p>
<p> While making novels about vicious, rabid dogs and sewer-dwelling monsters — as seen in Cujo and IT, respectively — King published several books as Richard Bachman. Four early novels — Rage (1977), The Long Walk (1979), Roadwork (1981) and The Running Man (1982) — were published under the moniker because of King's concern that the public wouldn't accept more than one book from an author within a year. He came up with the alias after seeing a novel by Richard Stark on his desk (actually a pseudonym used by Donald Westlake) coupled with what he heard playing on his record player at the time — "You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet," by Bachman Turner Overdrive. </p>
<p> Television and Film Adaptations </p>
<p> Although many of King's works were made into film or TV adaptations — Cujo and Firestarter were released for the big screen in 1983 and '84 respectively, while It debuted as a miniseries in 1990 — the film The Shining, released in 1980 and starring Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall, became a renowned horror thriller that has stood the test of time. </p>
<p> For a good portion of his career, King wrote novels and stories at a breakneck speed. He published several books per year for much of the 1980s and '90s. His compelling, thrilling tales have continued to be used as the basis of numerous films for the big and small screens. Actress Kathy Bates and actor James Caan starred in the critically and commercially successful adaptation of Misery in 1990, with Bates winning an Oscar for her performance as the psychotic Annie Wilkes. </p>
<p> Four years later, The Shawshank Redemption, starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman and based on one of his stories, became another acclaimed outing with multiple Oscar nominations. King's 1978 novel The Stand became a 1994 miniseries with Molly Ringwald and Gary Sinise in the lead, while the mid-'90s serialized outing The Green Mile was turned into a 1999 prison-based film starring Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan. </p>
<p> Later Work </p>
<p> King continues to create and be involved in provocative projects. He has worked directly in television, writing for series like Kingdom Hospital and Under the Dome, with the latter based on his 2009 novel. In 2011 he published 11/22/63, a novel involving time travel as part of an effort to stop the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. </p>
<p> King also wrote Joyland (2013), a pulp-fiction style thriller that takes readers on a journey to uncovering who's behind an unsolved murder. And he surprised audiences by releasing Doctor Sleep (2013), a sequel to The Shining, with Sleep hitting No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list. </p>
<p> The novelist then published Mr. Mercedes (2014), with Finders Keepers (2015) and End of Watch (2016) rounding out the trilogy. In 2017, he teamed with son Owen to deliver Sleeping Beauties, about a mysterious pandemic that leaves women enveloped in cocoons. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, adaptations of King's works have continued to populate the big and small screens. The first season of Mr. Mercedes began airing on the Audience Network in 2017, and that year a remake of the horror classic IT enjoyed a hefty box-office haul. In 2019 another remake of a signature King property, Pet Sematary, debuted in theaters. </p>
<p> Personal Life </p>
<p> King and his novelist wife divide their time between Florida and Maine. They have three children: Naomi Rachel, a reverend; Joseph Hillstrom, who writes under the pen name Joe Hill and is a lauded horror-fiction writer in his own right; and Owen Phillip, whose first collection of stories was published in 2005. </p>
<p> In honor of his prolific output and success in his craft, King was among the recipients of the National Medal of Arts in 2015. </p>
<p> Outside of writing, King is a music fan. He even sometimes plays guitar and sings in a band called Rock Bottom Remainders with fellow literary stars like Dave Barry, Barbara Kingsolver and Amy Tan. The group has performed a number of times over the years to raise money for charity. </p>

<p> Stephen King </p>
<p> Alternative Titles: Richard Bachmann, Stephen Edwin King </p>
<p> Stephen King, in full Stephen Edwin King, (born September 21, 1947, Portland, Maine, U.S.), American novelist and short-story writer whose books were credited with reviving the genre of horror fiction in the late 20th century. </p>
<p> King graduated from the University of Maine in 1970 with a bachelor’s degree in English. While writing short stories he supported himself by teaching and working as a janitor, among other jobs. His first published novel, Carrie, about a tormented teenage girl gifted with telekinetic powers, appeared in 1974 (film 1976 and 2013) and was an immediate popular success. </p>
<p> Carrie was the first of many novels in which King blended horror, the macabre, fantasy, and science fiction. Among such works were ’Salem’s Lot (1975; TV miniseries 1979 and 2004); The Shining (1977; film 1980; TV miniseries 1997); The Stand (1978; TV miniseries 1994); The Dead Zone (1979; film 1983; TV series 2002–07); Firestarter (1980; film 1984); Cujo (1981; film 1983); The Running Man (1982; film 1987); Christine (1983; film 1983); Thinner (1984; film 1996); It (1986; TV miniseries 1990; film 2017 and 2019); Misery (1987; film 1990); The Tommyknockers (1987; TV miniseries 1993); The Dark Half (1989; film 1993); Needful Things (1991; film 1993); Dolores Claiborne (1993; film 1995); Dreamcatcher (2001; film 2003); Cell and Lisey’s Story (both 2006); Duma Key (2008); Under the Dome (2009; TV series 2013–15); 11/22/63 (2011; TV miniseries 2016); Joyland (2013); Doctor Sleep (2013), a sequel to The Shining; Revival (2014); and The Institute (2019). King published several of those works, including The Dead Zone and The Running Man, under the pseudonym Richard Bachman. A collection of the first four Bachman novels, The Bachman Books (1985), contains the essay “Why I Was Bachman.” Mr. Mercedes (2014), Finders Keepers (2015), and End of Watch (2016) formed a trilogy of hard-boiled crime novels centring on retired detective Bill Hodges. King also wrote a serial novel, The Dark Tower, whose first installment, The Gunslinger, appeared in 1982; an eighth volume was published in 2012. A film adaptation of the series was released in 2017. </p>
<p> In his books King explored almost every terror-producing theme imaginable, from vampires, rabid dogs, deranged killers, and a pyromaniac to ghosts, extrasensory perception and telekinesis, biological warfare, and even a malevolent automobile. In his later fiction, exemplified by Dolores Claiborne, King departed from the horror genre to provide sharply detailed psychological portraits of his protagonists, many of them women, who confront difficult and challenging circumstances. Though his work was sometimes disparaged as undisciplined and inelegant, King was a talented storyteller whose books gained their effect from realistic detail, forceful plotting, and the author’s undoubted ability to involve and scare the reader. His work consistently addressed such themes as the potential for politics and technology to disrupt or even destroy an individual human life. Obsession, the forms it can assume, and its power to wreck individuals, families, and whole communities was a recurring theme in King’s fiction, driving the narratives of Christine, Misery, and Needful Things. </p>
<p> By the early 1990s King’s books had sold more than 100 million copies worldwide, and his name had become synonymous with the genre of horror fiction. His short fiction was collected in such volumes as Night Shift (1978), Nightmares and Dreamscapes (1993), Hearts in Atlantis (1999; film 2001), Just After Sunset (2008), and The Bazaar of Bad Dreams (2015). The story “Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,” which was published in Different Seasons (1982), inspired the hugely popular film The Shawshank Redemption (1994). </p>
<p> King wrote several motion-picture screenplays. Some of his novels were adapted for the screen by such directors as John Carpenter, David Cronenberg, Brian De Palma, Stanley Kubrick, and Rob Reiner. King explored both his own career and the craft of writing in On Writing (2000), a book he completed as he was recovering from severe injuries received after being struck by a car. King experimented with different forms of book distribution: The Plant: Zenith Rising was released in 2000 solely as an e-book, distributed via the Internet, with readers asked but not required to pay for it, and the novella UR was made available in 2009 only to users of the Kindle electronic reading device. The short story “Drunken Fireworks” was released in 2015 as an audiobook prior to its print publication. </p>
<p> King’s family included his wife, Tabitha King, and their two sons, Joe Hill and Owen King, all of whom were novelists. With Owen he wrote Sleeping Beauties (2017), in which women become wrapped in cocoons when they fall asleep. King received the National Book Foundation’s Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters in 2003 and the National Medal of Arts in 2015. </p>

<p> Stephen King </p>
<p> Stephen Edwin King (born September 21, 1947) is an American author of horror, supernatural fiction, suspense, and fantasy novels. His books have sold more than 350 million copies,[2] many of which have been adapted into feature films, miniseries, television series, and comic books. King has published 61 novels (including seven under the pen name Richard Bachman) and six non-fiction books.[3] He has written approximately 200 short stories,[4][5] most of which have been published in book collections. </p>
<p> Early life </p>
<p> Stephen King was born September 21, 1947, in Portland, Maine. His father, Donald Edwin King, was a merchant seaman. Donald was born under the surname Pollock, but as an adult, used the surname King.[10][11][12] King's mother was Nellie Ruth (née Pillsbury).[12] </p>
<p> When Stephen King was two years old, his father left the family. King's mother raised Stephen and his older brother, David, by herself, sometimes under great financial strain. The family moved to De Pere, Wisconsin; Fort Wayne, Indiana; and Stratford, Connecticut. When King was 11, his family returned to Durham, Maine, where his mother cared for her parents until their deaths. She then became a caregiver in a local residential facility for the mentally challenged.[1] King was raised Methodist[13] but lost his belief in organized religion while in high school. While no longer religious, King chooses to believe in the existence of God.[14] </p>
<p> As a child, King apparently witnessed one of his friends being struck and killed by a train, though he has no memory of the event. His family told him that after leaving home to play with the boy, King returned, speechless and seemingly in shock. Only later did the family learn of the friend's death. Some commentators have suggested that this event may have psychologically inspired some of King's darker works,[15] but King makes no mention of it in his memoir On Writing (2000). </p>
<p> King related in detail his primary inspiration for writing horror fiction in his non-fiction Danse Macabre (1981), in a chapter titled "An Annoying Autobiographical Pause." King compares his uncle's dowsing for water using the bough of an apple branch with the sudden realization of what he wanted to do for a living. That inspiration occurred while browsing through an attic with his elder brother, when King uncovered a paperback version of an H. P. Lovecraft collection of short stories he remembers as The Lurker in the Shadows, that had belonged to his father. King told Barnes & Noble Studios during a 2009 interview, "I knew that I'd found home when I read that book."[16] </p>
<p> King attended Durham Elementary School and graduated from Lisbon Falls High School, in Lisbon Falls, Maine in 1966.[17] He displayed an early interest in horror as an avid reader of EC's horror comics, including Tales from the Crypt (he later paid tribute to the comics in his screenplay for Creepshow). He began writing for fun while still in school, contributing articles to Dave's Rag, the newspaper his brother published with a mimeograph machine, and later began selling to his friends stories based on movies he had seen (though when discovered by his teachers, he was forced to return the profits). The first of his stories to be independently published was "I Was a Teenage Grave Robber"; it was serialized over four issues (three published and one unpublished) of a fanzine, Comics Review, in 1965. That story was published the following year in a revised form as "In a Half-World of Terror" in another fanzine, Stories of Suspense, edited by Marv Wolfman.[18] As a teen, King also won a Scholastic Art and Writing Award.[19] </p>
<p> From 1966, King studied at the University of Maine, graduating in 1970 with a Bachelor of Arts in English. That year, his daughter Naomi Rachel was born. He wrote a column, Steve King's Garbage Truck, for the student newspaper, The Maine Campus, and participated in a writing workshop organized by Burton Hatlen.[20] King held a variety of jobs to pay for his studies, including janitor, gas pump attendant, and worker at an industrial laundry. King met his future wife, fellow student Tabitha Spruce, at the University's Fogler Library after one of Professor Hatlen's workshops; they wed in 1971.[20] </p>
<p> Career </p>
<p> Beginnings </p>
<p> King sold his first professional short story, "The Glass Floor", to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967.[1] </p>
<p> After graduating from the University of Maine, King earned a certificate to teach high school but, unable to find a teaching post immediately, initially supplemented his laboring wage by selling short stories to men's magazines such as Cavalier. Many of these early stories have been republished in the collection Night Shift. The short story The Raft was published in Adam, a men's magazine. After being arrested for driving over a traffic cone, he was fined $250 and had no money to pay the petty larceny fine. However, payment arrived for the short story The Raft (then entitled The Float), and King was able to pay the fine.[21] In 1971, King was hired as a teacher at Hampden Academy in Hampden, Maine. He continued to contribute short stories to magazines and worked on ideas for novels.[1] </p>
<p> Carrie and aftermath </p>
<p> In 1973, King's novel Carrie was accepted by publishing house Doubleday. Carrie was King's fourth novel,[22] but it was the first to be published. It was written on a portable typewriter that belonged to his wife. The novel began as a short story intended for Cavalier magazine, but King tossed the first three pages of his work in the garbage can.[23] Tabitha King fished the pages out of the garbage can and encouraged him to finish the story, saying that she would help him with the female perspective; he followed her advice and expanded it into a novel.[24] King said, "I persisted because I was dry and had no better ideas… my considered opinion was that I had written the world's all-time loser."[25] According to The Guardian, Carrie "is the story of Carrie White, a high-school student with latent—and then, as the novel progresses, developing—telekinetic powers. It's brutal in places, affecting in others (Carrie's relationship with her almost hysterically religious mother being a particularly damaged one), and gory in even more."[26] </p>
<p> When Carrie was chosen for publication, King's phone was out of service. Doubleday editor William Thompson – who would eventually become King's close friend – sent a telegram to King's house in late March or early April 1973[27] which read: "Carrie Officially A Doubleday Book. $2,500 Advance Against Royalties. Congrats, Kid – The Future Lies Ahead, Bill."[28] According to King, he bought a new Ford Pinto with the money from the advance.[27] On May 13, 1973, New American Library bought the paperback rights for $400,000, which—in accordance with King's contract with Doubleday—was split between them.[29][30] Carrie set King's career in motion and became a significant novel in the horror genre.[31] </p>
<p> King's Salem's Lot was published in 1975. In a 1987 issue of The Highway Patrolman magazine, he stated, "The story seems sort of down home to me. I have a special cold spot in my heart for it!"[32] After his mother's death, King and his family moved to Boulder, Colorado, where King wrote The Shining (published 1977). The family returned to western Maine in 1975, where King completed his fourth novel, The Stand (published 1978). In 1977, the family, with the addition of Owen Phillip (his third and last child), traveled briefly to England, returning to Maine that fall, where King began teaching creative writing at the University of Maine.[33] </p>
<p> In 1982, King published Different Seasons, a collection of four novellas with a more serious dramatic bent than the horror fiction for which King is famous.[34] The collection is notable for having had three of its four novellas turned into Hollywood films: Stand by Me (1986) was adapted from the novella The Body,[35] The Shawshank Redemption (1994) was adapted from the novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,[36] and Apt Pupil (1998) was adapted from the novella of the same name.[37][38] </p>
<p> In 1985, King wrote his first work for the comic book medium,[39] writing a few pages of the benefit X-Men comic book Heroes for Hope Starring the X-Men. The book, whose profits were donated to assist with famine relief in Africa, was written by a number of different authors in the comic book field, such as Chris Claremont, Stan Lee, and Alan Moore, as well as authors not primarily associated with that industry, such as Harlan Ellison.[40] The following year, King published It (1986), which was the best-selling hard-cover novel in the United States that year,[41] and wrote the introduction to Batman No. 400, an anniversary issue in which he expressed his preference for that character over Superman.[42][43] </p>
<p> Pseudonyms </p>
<p> In the late 1970s and early 1980s, King published a handful of short novels—Rage (1977), The Long Walk (1979), Roadwork (1981), The Running Man (1982) and Thinner (1984)—under the pseudonym Richard Bachman. The idea behind this was to test whether he could replicate his success again and to allay his fears that his popularity was an accident. An alternate explanation was that publishing standards at the time allowed only a single book a year.[44] He picked up the name from the hard rock band Bachman-Turner Overdrive, of which he is a fan.[45] </p>
<p> Richard Bachman was exposed as King's pseudonym by a persistent Washington, D.C. bookstore clerk, Steve Brown, who noticed similarities between the works and later located publisher's records at the Library of Congress that named King as the author of one of Bachman's novels.[46] This led to a press release heralding Bachman's "death"—supposedly from "cancer of the pseudonym".[47] King dedicated his 1989 book The Dark Half, about a pseudonym turning on a writer, to "the deceased Richard Bachman", and in 1996, when the Stephen King novel Desperation was released, the companion novel The Regulators carried the "Bachman" byline. </p>
<p> In 2006, during a press conference in London, King declared that he had discovered another Bachman novel, titled Blaze. It was published on June 12, 2007. In fact, the original manuscript had been held at King's alma mater, the University of Maine in Orono, for many years and had been covered by numerous King experts. King rewrote the original 1973 manuscript for its publication.[48] </p>
<p> King has used other pseudonyms. The short story "The Fifth Quarter" was published under the pseudonym John Swithen (the name of a character in the novel Carrie), by Cavalier in April 1972.[49] The story was reprinted in King's collection Nightmares & Dreamscapes in 1993 under his own name. In the introduction to the Bachman novel Blaze, King claims, with tongue-in-cheek, that "Bachman" was the person using the Swithen pseudonym. </p>

<p> In 2000, King published online a serialized horror novel, The Plant.[52] At first the public presumed that King had abandoned the project because sales were unsuccessful, but King later stated that he had simply run out of stories.[53] The unfinished epistolary novel is still available from King's official site, now free. Also in 2000, he wrote a digital novella, Riding the Bullet, and has said he sees e-books becoming 50% of the market "probably by 2013 and maybe by 2012". But he also warns: "Here's the thing—people tire of the new toys quickly."[54] </p>
<p> King wrote the first draft of the 2001 novel Dreamcatcher with a notebook and a Waterman fountain pen, which he called "the world's finest word processor".[55] </p>
<p> In August 2003, King began writing a column on pop culture appearing in Entertainment Weekly, usually every third week. The column, called The Pop of King (a play on the nickname "The King of Pop" commonly attributed to Michael Jackson).[56] </p>
<p> In 2006, King published an apocalyptic novel, Cell. The book features a sudden force in which every cell phone user turns into a mindless killer. King noted in the book's introduction that he does not use cell phones. </p>
<p> In 2008, King published both a novel, Duma Key, and a collection, Just After Sunset. The latter featured 13 short stories, including a previously unpublished novella, N. Starting July 28, 2008, N. was released as a serialized animated series to lead up to the release of Just After Sunset.[57] </p>
<p> In 2009, King published Ur, a novella written exclusively for the launch of the second-generation Amazon Kindle and available only on Amazon.com, and Throttle, a novella co-written with his son Joe Hill and released later as an audiobook titled Road Rage, which included Richard Matheson's short story "Duel". King's novel Under the Dome was published on November 10 of that year; it is a reworking of an unfinished novel he tried writing twice in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and at 1,074 pages, it is the largest novel he has written since It (1986). Under the Dome debuted at No. 1 in The New York Times Bestseller List.[58] </p>
<p> On February 16, 2010, King announced on his Web site that his next book would be a collection of four previously unpublished novellas called Full Dark, No Stars. In April of that year, King published Blockade Billy, an original novella issued first by independent small press Cemetery Dance Publications and later released in mass-market paperback by Simon & Schuster. The following month, DC Comics premiered American Vampire, a monthly comic book series written by King with short-story writer Scott Snyder, and illustrated by Rafael Albuquerque, which represents King's first original comics work.[59][60][61] King wrote the background history of the very first American vampire, Skinner Sweet, in the first five-issues story arc. Scott Snyder wrote the story of Pearl.[62] </p>
<p> King's next novel, 11/22/63, was published November 8, 2011,[63][64] and was nominated for the 2012 World Fantasy Award Best Novel.[65] The eighth Dark Tower volume, The Wind Through the Keyhole, was published in 2012.[66] King's next book was Joyland, a novel about "an amusement-park serial killer", according to an article in The Sunday Times, published on April 8, 2012.[67] </p>
<p> During his Chancellor's Speaker Series talk at University of Massachusetts Lowell on December 7, 2012, King indicated that he was writing a crime novel about a retired policeman being taunted by a murderer. With a working title Mr. Mercedes and inspired by a true event about a woman driving her car into a McDonald's restaurant, it was originally meant to be a short story just a few pages long.[68] In an interview with Parade, published May 26, 2013, King confirmed that the novel was "more or less" completed[69] he published it in June 2013. Later, on June 20, 2013, while doing a video chat with fans as part of promoting the upcoming Under the Dome TV series, King mentioned he was halfway through writing his next novel, Revival,[70] which was released November 11, 2014.[71] </p>
<p> King announced in June 2014 that Mr. Mercedes is part of a trilogy; the second book, Finders Keepers, was released on June 2, 2015. On April 22, 2015, it was revealed that King was working on the third book of the trilogy, End of Watch, which was ultimately released on June 7, 2016.[72][73] </p>
<p> During a tour to promote End of Watch, King revealed that he had collaborated on a novel, set in a women's prison in West Virginia, with his son, Owen King to be titled Sleeping Beauties.[74] </p>
<p> Collaborations </p>
<p> Writings </p>
<p> King has written two novels with horror novelist Peter Straub: The Talisman (1984) and a sequel, Black House (2001). King has indicated that he and Straub will likely write the third and concluding book in this series, the tale of Jack Sawyer, but has set no deadline for its completion.[citation needed] </p>
<p> The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer: My Life at Rose Red (2001) was a paperback tie-in for the King-penned miniseries Rose Red (2002). Published under anonymous authorship, the book was written by Ridley Pearson. The novel is written in the form of a diary by Ellen Rimbauer, and annotated by the fictional professor of paranormal activity, Joyce Reardon. The novel also presents a fictional afterword by Ellen Rimbauer's grandson, Steven. Intended to be a promotional item rather than a stand-alone work, its popularity spawned a 2003 prequel television miniseries to Rose Red, titled The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer. This spin-off is a rare occasion of another author being granted permission to write commercial work using characters and story elements invented by King. The novel tie-in idea was repeated on Stephen King's next project, the miniseries Kingdom Hospital. Richard Dooling, King's collaborator on Kingdom Hospital and writer of several episodes in the miniseries, published a fictional diary, The Journals of Eleanor Druse, in 2004. Eleanor Druse is a key character in Kingdom Hospital, much as Dr. Joyce Readon and Ellen Rimbauer are key characters in Rose Red.[citation needed] </p>
<p> Throttle (2009), a novella written in collaboration with his son Joe Hill, appears in the anthology He Is Legend: Celebrating Richard Matheson.[76] Their second novella collaboration, In the Tall Grass (2012), was published in two parts in Esquire.[77][78] It was later released in e-book and audiobook formats, the latter read by Stephen Lang.[79] </p>
<p> Analysis </p>
<p> Writing style and approach </p>
<p> Stephen King in 2011 </p>
<p> King's formula for learning to write well is: "Read and write four to six hours a day. If you cannot find the time for that, you can't expect to become a good writer." He sets out each day with a quota of 2000 words and will not stop writing until it is met. He also has a simple definition for talent in writing: "If you wrote something for which someone sent you a check, if you cashed the check and it didn't bounce, and if you then paid the light bill with the money, I consider you talented."[89] </p>
<p> When asked why he writes, King responds: "The answer to that is fairly simple—there was nothing else I was made to do. I was made to write stories and I love to write stories. That's why I do it. I really can't imagine doing anything else and I can't imagine not doing what I do."[90] He is also often asked why he writes such terrifying stories and he answers with another question: "Why do you assume I have a choice?"[91] King usually begins the story creation process by imagining a "what if" scenario, such as what would happen if a writer is kidnapped by a sadistic nurse in Colorado.[92] </p>
<p> Influences </p>
<p> King has called Richard Matheson "the author who influenced me most as a writer."[94] In a current edition of Matheson's The Shrinking Man, King is quoted as saying, "A horror story if there ever was one...a great adventure story—it is certainly one of that select handful that I have given to people, envying them the experience of the first reading." </p>
<p> Critical response </p>
<p> Science fiction editors John Clute and Peter Nichols[101] offer a largely favorable appraisal of King, noting his "pungent prose, sharp ear for dialogue, disarmingly laid-back, frank style, along with his passionately fierce denunciation of human stupidity and cruelty (especially to children) [all of which rank] him among the more distinguished 'popular' writers." </p>
<p> In his book The Philosophy of Horror (1990), Noël Carroll discusses King's work as an exemplar of modern horror fiction. Analyzing both the narrative structure of King's fiction and King's non-fiction ruminations on the art and craft of writing, Carroll writes that for King, "the horror story is always a contest between the normal and the abnormal such that the normal is reinstated and, therefore, affirmed."[102] </p>
<p> In his analysis of post–World War II horror fiction, The Modern Weird Tale (2001), critic S. T. Joshi[103] devotes a chapter to King's work. Joshi argues that King's best-known works (his supernatural novels), are his worst, describing them as mostly bloated, illogical, maudlin and prone to deus ex machina endings. Despite these criticisms, Joshi argues that since Gerald's Game (1993), King has been tempering the worst of his writing faults, producing books that are leaner, more believable and generally better written. </p>
<p> In his short story collection A Century of Great Suspense Stories, editor Jeffery Deaver noted that King "singlehandedly made popular fiction grow up. While there were many good best-selling writers before him, King, more than anybody since John D. MacDonald, brought reality to genre novels. He has often remarked that 'Salem's Lot was "Peyton Place meets Dracula. And so it was. The rich characterization, the careful and caring social eye, the interplay of story line and character development announced that writers could take worn themes such as vampirism and make them fresh again. Before King, many popular writers found their efforts to make their books serious blue-penciled by their editors. 'Stuff like that gets in the way of the story,' they were told. Well, it's stuff like that that has made King so popular, and helped free the popular name from the shackles of simple genre writing. He is a master of masters."[105] </p>
<p> In 2003, King was honored by the National Book Awards with a lifetime achievement award, the Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. Some in the literary community expressed disapproval of the award: Richard E. Snyder, the former CEO of Simon & Schuster, described King's work as "non-literature" and critic Harold Bloom denounced the choice: </p>
<p> The decision to give the National Book Foundation's annual award for "distinguished contribution" to Stephen King is extraordinary, another low in the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life. I've described King in the past as a writer of penny dreadfuls, but perhaps even that is too kind. He shares nothing with Edgar Allan Poe. What he is is an immensely inadequate writer on a sentence-by-sentence, paragraph-by-paragraph, book-by-book basis.[106] </p>
<p> Let me assure you that King's work most definitely is literature, because it was written to be published and is read with admiration. What Snyder really means is that it is not the literature preferred by the academic-literary elite.[107] </p>
<p> In 2008, King's book On Writing was ranked 21st on Entertainment Weekly list of "The New Classics: The 100 Best Reads from 1983 to 2008".[108] </p>
<p> Appearances and adaptations in other media </p>
<p> King and his wife Tabitha own Zone Radio Corp, a radio station group consisting of WZON/620 AM,[109] WKIT-FM/100.3 & WZLO/103.1. </p>
<p> King tried his hand at directing with Maximum Overdrive, in which he also made a cameo appearance as a man using a malfunctioning ATM.[110] </p>
<p> In 2010, King appeared in a cameo role as a cleaner named Bachman (a reference to his pen name Richard Bachman) on the FX series Sons of Anarchy.[112] </p>
<p> The Syfy TV series Haven is based on King's novella, The Colorado Kid.[113] </p>
<p> In 2019, King appeared in a cameo role as a thrift store owner in It Chapter Two.[114] </p>
<p> Political views and activism </p>
<p> In April 2008, King spoke out against HB 1423, a bill pending in the Massachusetts state legislature that would restrict or ban the sale of violent video games to anyone under the age of 18. King argued that such laws allow legislators to ignore the economic divide between the rich and poor and the easy availability of guns, which he believed were the actual causes of violence.[115] </p>
<p> A controversy emerged on May 5, 2008 when Noel Sheppard posted a clip of King at a Library of Congress reading event on the Web site NewsBusters. King, talking to high-school students, had said: "If you can read, you can walk into a job later on. If you don't, then you've got the Army, Iraq, I don't know, something like that."[116] The comment was described by the blog as "another in a long line of liberal media members bashing the military," and likened to John Kerry's similar remark from 2006.[117] King responded later that day, saying, "That a right-wing-blog would impugn my patriotism because I said children should learn to read, and could get better jobs by doing so, is beneath contempt...I live in a national guard town, and I support our troops, but I don't support either the war or educational policies that limit the options of young men and women to any one career—military or otherwise." King later expressed regret for the remark, saying that he misspoke. King added that during the Vietnam War, serving in the military was a great career for some.[118] </p>
<p> During the 2008 presidential election, King voiced his support for Democratic candidate Barack Obama.[119] King was quoted as calling conservative commentator Glenn Beck "Satan's mentally challenged younger brother."[120] </p>
<p> On April 30, 2012, King published an article in The Daily Beast calling for rich Americans, including himself, to pay more taxes, citing it as "a practical necessity and moral imperative that those who have received much should be obligated to pay ... in the same proportion".[122] </p>
<p> On January 25, 2013, King published an essay titled "Guns" via Amazon.com's Kindle single feature, which discusses the gun debate in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. King called for gun owners to support a ban on automatic and semi-automatic weapons, writing, "Autos and semi-autos are weapons of mass destruction...When lunatics want to make war on the unarmed and unprepared, these are the weapons they use."[123][124] The essay became the fifth-bestselling non-fiction title for the Kindle.[125] </p>
<p> In June 2018, King called for the release of the Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov who is jailed in Russia.[129] </p>
<p> Maine politics </p>
<p> King publicly criticized Paul LePage during LePage's tenure as Governor of Maine, referring to him as one of The Three Stooges (with then-Florida Governor Rick Scott and then-Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker being the other two).[121] He was critical of LePage for incorrectly suggesting in a 2015 radio address that King avoided paying Maine income taxes by living out of state for part of the year. The statement was later corrected by the Governor's office, but no apology was issued. King said LePage was "full of the stuff that makes the grass grow green"[131] and demanded that LePage "man up and apologize".[132] LePage declined to apologize to King, stating, "I never said Stephen King did not pay income taxes. What I said was, Stephen King's not in Maine right now. That's what I said."[133] </p>
<p> The attention garnered by the LePage criticism led to efforts to encourage King to run for Governor of Maine in 2018.[134] King stated he would not run or serve.[135] King sent a tweet on June 30, 2015 calling LePage "a terrible embarrassment to the state I live in and love. If he won't govern, he should resign." He later clarified that he was not calling on LePage to resign, but to "go to work or go back home."[136] On August 27, 2016, King called LePage "a bigot, a homophobe, and a racist".[137] </p>
<p> Philanthropy </p>
<p> King has stated that he donates approximately $4 million per year "to libraries, local fire departments that need updated lifesaving equipment (Jaws of Life tools are always a popular request), schools, and a scattering of organisations that underwrite the arts."[122][138] </p>
<p> The Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation, chaired by King and his wife, ranks sixth among Maine charities in terms of average annual giving with over $2.8 million in grants per year, according to The Grantsmanship Center.[139] </p>
<p> In November 2011, the STK Foundation donated $70,000 in matched funding via his radio station to help pay the heating bills for families in need in his home town of Bangor, Maine, during the winter.[140] </p>
<p> Personal life </p>
<p> King married Tabitha Spruce on January 2, 1971.[141] She too is a novelist and philanthropic activist. The couple own and divide their time between three houses: one in Bangor, Maine, one in Lovell, Maine, and for the winter a waterfront mansion located off the Gulf of Mexico in Sarasota, Florida. The Kings have three children, a daughter and two sons, and four grandchildren.[1] Their daughter Naomi is a Unitarian Universalist Church minister in Plantation, Florida, with her lesbian partner, Rev. Dr. Thandeka.[142] Both of the Kings' sons are authors: Owen King published his first collection of stories, We're All in This Together: A Novella and Stories, in 2005. Joseph Hillstrom King, who writes as Joe Hill, published a collection of short stories, 20th Century Ghosts, in 2005. His debut novel, Heart-Shaped Box (2007), was optioned by Warners Bros.[143] </p>
<p> In the early 1970s, King developed a drinking problem which would plague him for more than a decade.[144] Soon after Carrie's release in 1974, King's mother died of uterine cancer; King has written of his severe drinking problem at this time, stating that he was drunk while delivering the eulogy at his mother's funeral.[145]:69 King's addictions to alcohol and other drugs were so serious during the 1980s that, as he acknowledged in On Writing in 2000, he can barely remember writing Cujo.[145]:73 Shortly after the novel's publication, King's family and friends staged an intervention, dumping on the rug in front of him evidence of his addictions taken from his office including beer cans, cigarette butts, grams of cocaine, Xanax, Valium, NyQuil, dextromethorphan (cough medicine) and marijuana. As King related in his memoir, he then sought help, quit all drugs (including alcohol) in the late 1980s, and has remained sober since.[145]:72 The first novel he wrote after becoming sober was Needful Things.[146] </p>
<p> Car accident and aftermath </p>
<p> On June 19, 1999, at about 4:30 p.m., King was walking on the shoulder of Maine State Route 5, in Lovell, Maine. Driver Bryan Edwin Smith, distracted by an unrestrained dog moving in the back of his minivan, struck King, who landed in a depression in the ground about 14 feet (four meters) from the pavement of Route 5.[145]:206 According to Oxford County Sheriff deputy Matt Baker, King was hit from behind and some witnesses said the driver was not speeding, reckless, or drinking.[147] In his book On Writing, King states he was heading north, walking against the traffic. Shortly before the accident took place, a woman in a car, also northbound, passed King first and then the light-blue Dodge van. The van was looping from one side of the road to the other, and the woman told her passenger she hoped "that guy in the van doesn't hit him."[145]:206 </p>
<p> King was conscious enough to give the deputy phone numbers to contact his family, but was in considerable pain. He was transported to Northern Cumberland Hospital in Bridgton and then flown by air ambulance to Central Maine Medical Center (CMMC) in Lewiston. His injuries—a collapsed right lung, multiple fractures of his right leg, scalp laceration and a broken hip—kept him at CMMC until July 9. His leg bones were so shattered that doctors initially considered amputating his leg, but stabilized the bones in the leg with an external fixator.[148] After five operations in 10 days and physical therapy, King resumed work on On Writing in July, though his hip was still shattered and he could sit for only about 40 minutes before the pain became unbearable.[145]:216 </p>
<p> King's lawyer and two others purchased Smith's van for $1,500, reportedly to prevent it from appearing on eBay. The van was later crushed at a junkyard, to King's disappointment, as he had fantasized about smashing it.[149][150] </p>

<p> All 64 Stephen King Books, Ranked </p>
<p> This week, Stephen King releases his latest novel, Mr. Mercedes. It is his 65th book, if you count novels, nonfiction, and short-story collections, and we are using its publication as an excuse to look back over nearly 40 years’ worth of his work and make the tough, ruthless calls to rank them all — no cop-out ties allowed. (Note: Mr. Mercedes is not included in this ranking.) </p>
<p> 64. Rose Madder: In the early nineties, King wrote a set of novels focused on abused women and the horrible men who beat and haunt and entrap them. This one was the last and least of the bunch. The combination of the real (the title character, the battered women’s shelter she ends up with, her monster of a husband) with the supernatural (a magical painting that offers a gateway to a Greek myth-tinged world) feels less convincing here than it does in any other of King’s books. </p>
<p> 63. The Tommyknockers: This tale of a Maine writer (you’ll be seeing a lot of these) who accidentally comes across a piece of alien metal in her backyard and finds herself compelled to dig up the flying saucer that it’s attached to was written at the height of King’s addiction troubles. Writing with “his heart running at a hundred and thirty beats a minute and cotton swabs stuck up my nose to stem the coke-induced bleeding” (as he would later describe it), King filled his book with addicts and thinly veiled metaphors for what he was going through. Full of anger at himself and the eighties, The Tommyknockers is a white-hot mess. Anyone who remembers the deadly levitating Coke machine would agree. </p>
<p> 62. Dreamcatcher: King’s first novel released after the 1999 car accident that nearly killed him, Dreamcatcher is so body-obsessed as to be off-putting. Though the descriptions of the pain and suffering felt by the main character (who suffers a similarly crippling accident) are convincing for obvious reasons, the book’s “shit weasels” — which literally make their way out of human bodies by getting crapped out — are the lowest type of gross-out horror. The only thing worse is the clichéd Down syndrome–afflicted character with the telepathic powers. </p>
<p> 61. Insomnia: Unless you are familiar with King’s epic Dark Tower series, entire swaths of this gargantuan novel are unreadable. Though the sections dealing with the elderly protagonist and his lady love have a poignance to them, they are undercut by heavy-handed subplots about spousal abuse and the pro-choice/pro-life debate. </p>
<p> 60. The Regulators: In 1996, King released two books simultaneously — one under his own name and one under his retired pseudonym, Richard Bachman. Meant to be carnival mirror reflections of each other, the two books feature many of the same characters, though with different motivations and circumstances in each. This one, the Bachman book, tells the story of a small-town street that is beset by two vans full of gun-wielding murderers. That description makes the book sound more coherent than it actually is — as the bad guys have been summoned by the mind of a TV-obsessed autistic boy possessed by an alien being. It’s like that Twilight Zone episode where the little boy turns one guy into a jack-in-the-box, but more with people getting their heads blown off. </p>
<p> 59. Rage: Originally published as a Bachman book, this was actually the first full-length novel that King ever finished. Concerned with a high-school student who kills two teachers and takes over a classroom, the story is very much the work of an angry young man — overheated and full of big talk. Wisely or not, King allowed the book to go out of print, partly because of a fear of having future school shootings linked to it. </p>
<p> 58. The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah: Taking place over the span of a single day, the sixth entry in King’s Dark Tower opus is its most minor. Blame its place in the series (the relatively slim book serves mainly as a transition volume between two thick volumes) or its mind-boggling metafictional flourish. Either way, it it an odd fit with everything that preceded it. </p>
<p> 57. Blaze: Originally written right before Carrie, but kept in King’s trunk until 2007, when he published it under the Bachman name, Blaze is a wisp of a tale. A noir-light about a brain-damaged crook who steals a rich man’s child in order to ransom it off before he finds himself getting too attached, it thankfully stops two steps short of over-sentimentality. Yet there’s almost nothing memorable about the story other than the ways in which it reminded us of Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men. </p>
<p> 56. Gerald’s Game: The first in King’s early nineties feminist cycle, Gerald’s Game takes place almost entirely in one room, with one character. Handcuffed to her cabin bed after her husband dies in the middle of a naughty sex game, Jessie must somehow find a way to escape. The one-room, one-woman setting allows King to overindulge in one of his most recognizable (and sometimes frustrating) tics: the character who speaks out loud to themselves for no good reason. Though the supernatural is absent from this novel (as it is in many of his books, despite King’s reputation), there remains in this novel one of the author’s scariest reveals. </p>
<p> 55. Cell: After a pulse of some sort turns everyone who is talking on their cell phones into murderous zombies, the survivors (all of whom turn out to be sarcastic smart-asses) walk around and speak in ways that no one in a zombie apocalypse ever would. Though it delivers some great setpieces, it also contains the worst dialogue King’s ever written. </p>
<p> 54. Blockade Billy: “The game was played hard in those days … with plenty of fuck-you.” Apparently, baseball used to be a rough sport. This novella is a trifle, but King writes lovingly about his favorite game. </p>
<p> 53. Cycle of the Werewolf: Originally intended to be twelve vignette-length segments, each of which would run alongside an illustration in a calendar, Werewolf sees King regress to cheesy, gory prose reminiscent of the beloved EC Comics of his youth. </p>
<p> 52. The Colorado Kid: A slim addition to the fun Hard Case Crime series of books, this tale of a young newspaper reporter, her two crochety editors, and the mysterious story they unspool has angered many readers with its deliberate lack of closure. But, as King writes, “Wanting might be better than knowing.” </p>
<p> 51. Black House: Released the week of September 11, this sequel to 1984’s King/Peter Straub co-written novel The Talisman picks up the story of Jack Sawyer who, when younger, traveled to a parallel world called the Territories. As with Insomnia, there are chunks of Black House undecipherable to the Dark Tower uninitiated. Yet there is both an authorly tension and bond between King and Straub that results in more lovely passages than the typical lesser King book has any right to offer. </p>
<p> 50. Needful Things: King’s “Last Castle Rock Story” (the fictional locale was the setting for The Dead Zone, Cujo, and The Dark Half) sees a man named Leland Gaunt roll into town to open the titular curiosity shop. It’s the type of place you can get anything you want — for a price. Partially a satirical look at Reagan-era American materalism, the book plays broader than it should, but less funny than King (who considers the book a black comedy) would have liked. </p>
<p> 49. Christine: “Kids are a downtrodden class.” In the early part of his career, King wrote thousands of pages on this very point. But when it comes to kids and outcasts and the dangers of adolescence, Christine — about a killer car that entrances the mind of a high-school loser — just skims the surface of those most transformative years. Future kid-centered books would be both scarier and deeper. </p>
<p> 48. Duma Key: Another attempt at hashing out the lingering effects of his car accident on the page, Duma Key finds King writing about a non-writer artist for the first time. Edgar loses his arm in a construction accident but gains the ability to make things happen when he paints them. Set in Florida, where King now lives for much of the year, Duma Key locates the (non-political) horrors of that fecund, overgrown state. But the novel, like many of King’s later works, could have used judicious pruning. </p>
<p> 47. The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon: As many characters on HBO’s Game of Thrones like to say, “The night is dark, and full of terrors.” But, and this bears repeating, when it comes to King, the terrors are not always monsters. Sometimes they’re men. And sometimes, it’s nature, as in this tiny realist portrait of a 9-year old girl who gets lost in the woods. As she wanders, afraid and alone, the only thing to keep her company is her radio, broadcasting a Red Sox game featuring her favorite player. It’s a simple story about a simple lesson: “The world had teeth and it could bite you with them anytime it wanted.” </p>
<p> 46. Four Past Midnight: A collection of four novellas that contains both one of King’s most ingenious situations (in The Langoliers, a group of plane passengers slip through a crack in time to a few minutes before, where the monsters reponsible for eating the past exist) and one of his most unreadable stories (The Library Policeman, which mixes childhood trauma and supernatural horror in a most unsatisfying way). </p>
<p> 45. Firestarter: King is in full on “paranoid dude of the sixties-seventies mode” here. The Shop is a secret government agency that, on account of an experiment it performs on one college campus, inadvertantly creates two students with special powers. They marry and have a kid who is capable of wreaking fantastic havoc through her psychic control of fire. With several wonderfully tense set pieces, the book nonetheless has a few too many stationary scenes set in an underground government bunker. </p>
<p> 44. Joyland: King’s second book for the pulp retro publisher Hard Case Crime (the first was #52, The Colorado Kid), Joyland is a small tale about a boy who goes to work in a rundown theme park in North Carolina and becomes a man. It’s a sweet coming-of-age story with a slight mystery lightly wrapped around it, as well as some minor supernatural doings, but at this point, those feel like reflexive tics on King’s part more than anything else. The thing that comes through most in slim books like this, Colorado Kid, and The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is how quickly and efficiently King can write a character that feels like someone we’ve long known. </p>
<p> 43. Nightmares & Dreamscapes: His third short story collection, this book’s a beast, big and baggy. But there’s enough of a mix of the surreal (the story with the human finger sticking out of a drain), the silly (the haunted toilet stall) and the scary (the Lovecraftian “Crouch End”) to prop up the lesser tales. </p>
<p> 42. The Running Man: Another angry Bachman book, another plot about a dystopian game show. But this one’s a slam-bang action-suspense story (supposedly written over the course of anywhere from three days to a week), in which one man must evade a group of well-supplied hunters out to kill him on live TV. The novel (spoiler alert!) ends with our hero flying a jet into a skyscraper. Like Tom Clancy’s Debt of Honor, in which an embittered pilot flies a passenger jet into the U.S. Capitol, it is hard to read the climax of The Running Man without dredging up the obvious associations. </p>
<p> 41. Faithful: It’s hard to fully enjoy this book if you’re not a baseball fan (and more specifically, if you’re not a Red Sox fan). Co-written by King and novelist Stewart O’Nan, it follows the two of them through the 2004 season, when the Sox miraculously and finally won their first World Series in 86 years. For those who aren’t fans, it gives readers this insight into the depth of King’s reading obsession: “Baseball is a great game because you can multitask in so many ways and never miss a single pitch. I find I can read two pages of a book during each commercial break.” </p>
<p> 40. Just After Sunset: This 2008 collection was a reminder that King is the only best-selling popular novelist who still regularly traffics in the short-story form. One of the book’s longer stories (“N”) is classic cosmic horror in the vein of Arthur Machen (directly) and H.P. Lovecraft (indirectly). “The Cat From Hell” and “A Very Tight Place” are both the right kinds of gory-nasty, while “They Things They Left Behind” subtly deals with 9/11 survivor’s guilt. A solid late career addition. </p>
<p> 39. The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla: The Dark Tower series has always been a genre mash-up, but it was only in Wolves of the Calla that readers first realized how all-encompassing King was going to be in his vision. A loose rewriting of The Magnificent Seven, Calla also manages to throw in significant references to Star Wars, Harry Potter, and Marvel Comics. The climactic confrontation is a prime example of what King does not do well — battle scenes. Hundreds of pages of dialogue and it’s all over in seconds. Sure, that’s how gun battles typically go down, we reckon, but give us a little more, man! </p>
<p> 38. Bag of Bones: “Readers have a loyalty that cannot be matched anywhere else in the creative arts,” says Mike Noonan, the Stephen King stand-in and protagonist of Bag of Bones. “Which explains why so many writers who have run out of gas can keep coasting anyway, propelled onto the bestseller lists by the magic words Author of on the covers of their books.” King has yet to run out of gas, and critics have responded — since the turn of the century, he has experienced increasingly positive notices for his novels. This book was the turning point, pushed by new publisher Scribner (of Fitzgerald and Hemingway fame) as a piece of literary, rather than genre, fiction. Still, it’s not nearly as good as the critics thought, full of King standards (a Maine writer, a dead family member, the past resurfacing, puzzles to be solved) that have trouble convincing us that they are anything but the same old. </p>
<p> 37. Everything’s Eventual: Another short-story collection, this one features four King tales that made it into The New Yorker, including “That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is in French” (is that a New Yorker title, or what?) and “The Man in the Black Suit,” which won King an O. Henry award in 1995. The book was published in 2002, right as the critical shift toward King had approached one of its peaks (the following year, he would receive a lifetime achievement award from the National Book Foundation). Still, for all their literary merit, few of the stories stick in your nerve centers. </p>
<p> 36. The Dark Tower: The Wind Through the Keyhole: Or, Dark Tower 4.5, as King is calling his latest release. Set in between the events of Wizard and Glass and Wolves of the Calla, Keyhole contains a story within a story, a fairy tale of great adventure and beauty. Because of its interstitial position, though, the book cannot wholly live on its own. </p>
<p> 35. Desperation: If The Regulators (No. 60) is about TV, Stephen King once said, then Desperation is about God. The second half of the Bachman-King double feature finds the Lord channeled through a young boy, one who is forced to become a religious leader of sorts for a group of people trapped in a small desert town and hunted by a demon-posessed sheriff. It’s a book that manages to balance scenes of complete gross-out horror with tiny moments of grace. </p>
<p> 34. Thinner: He should have just published it under his own name, it was so familiar and Stephen King–ish. But Thinner, with its supernatural plot of an obese lawyer who starts to lose weight, unceasingly, after a gypsy curses him, was released under King’s pseudonym, Richard Bachman. With four books to his credit, Bachman had never written a story with anything approaching the otherworldly, which tipped some off that King and Bachman might be the same. A harsh look at American success and excess and avarice, Thinner takes a Tales From the Crypt conceit and spins it into something lean and mean. </p>
<p> 33. Full Dark, No Stars: The four novellas in this collection are all tales of revenge. They’re bleak as hell and that’s what makes them so good (though not even close to the four novellas in Different Seasons, which we’ll talk about later). The quartet’s unyielding darkness appeared to be King pushing back a little against his late-career critical bump. “I have no quarrel with literary fiction, which usually concerns itself with extraordinary people in ordinary situations,” he wrote. “But as both a reader and a writer, I’m much more interested by ordinary people in extraordinary situations. I want to provoke an emotional, even visceral, reaction in my readers. Making them think as they read is not my deal.” </p>
<p> 32. The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands: It is in this third volume of his magnum opus that King truly begins to give us a sense of the world he has created — in actuality, it’s many worlds. A multiverse, in the most comic-book sense of the word: The Dark Tower of the title is the thing that holds all realities, all worlds together. Demerits for the puzzle-happy talking train that arrives at book’s end, but points galore for setting the stakes as high as possible for his heroes. </p>
<p> 31. The Long Walk: This Bachman book imagines a dystopian United States where 100 young men are forced to participate in a death march through Maine. The winner is lavished with anything he wants. The whole thing is televised, and the nation watches with sick glee. Each chapter opens with a quote from a game show, but the most germane is one from The Gong Show’s Chuck Barris: “The ultimate game show would be one where the losing contestant was killed.” The Hunger Games before The Hunger Games, but with a world-weary, Vietnam-draft metaphor to boot. </p>
<p> 30. Cujo: Thirty years later, the name still serves as shorthand for a vicious dog. And it’s a vicious book (that ending!), one that even manages to take us, if briefly, into the point of view of a rabid pooch. It was King’s first explicitly non-supernatural book (there are some hints here and there, but it’s mostly rabies and human weakness to blame) and so is important, though it is firmly of middle quality. </p>
<p> 29. The Dark Half: “Pseudonyms were only a higher form of fictional character,” writes King in this 1989 novel. Taking the circumstances surrounding the unmasking of Richard Bachman and poking them with a stick, he imagines a pen name that won’t stay dead. In between all the messy razor killings and flocks of ominous sparrows are a great many passages that reveal the inner mind of the fiction writer — he who exists in two different realities at the same time, “The one in the real world and the one in the manuscript world.” </p>
<p> 28. The Eyes of the Dragon: A fairy tale written by King for his daughter Naomi. Granted, it’s a long fairy tale, but it’s perfect in tone and the obvious signifiers — dragons, towers, kings, and princes. </p>
<p> 27. Doctor Sleep: King had been in this situation before — he released a sequel for one of his many young characters with 2001’s Black House. The difference here is that this time around, he was dealing with one of his most famous books and characters. (Partly made so by the Stanley Kubrick movie version that King has spent over three decades insulting.) The expectations were high, and it’s amazing that King didn’t completely whiff. How much Doctor Sleep succeeds depends on your desire to re-create the frights of The Shining, which are largely absent here. King knows as much — on the press tour, he’s said that his current work is more like a curve or change-up than a fastball. (The man loves baseball!) Danny Torrance is all grown up now, and like his old man Jack he likes to drink. He ends up in AA, of which the book and its AA-attending author have much to say, and crosses paths with an evil group called the True Knot, who get their power from killing kids with the shining. The book flies, but misses that Shining punch, leading to a conclusion in which the villains, as is often the case in King books, turn out to be less dangerous than they seem. </p>
<p> 26. The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower: Bloated to a certain degree, the book also falls flat when it finally unveils the villain who has loomed so large over the series. But the saga’s conclusion also contains one of the most honestly tear-jerking scenes in all of King’s work. And though there are many who fall on either side of this debate, we consider the book’s final ending to be satisfying in a way we didn’t think possible. </p>
<p> 25. Carrie: The first novel, the breakthrough, the book that kicked off one of American fiction’s most successful and long-lasting careers. All of that is true. But the thing itself — book as text, not context — often feels like a screenplay outline padded out by faux-newspaper and academic journal reports. </p>
<p> 24. 11/22/63: It is a liberal boomer’s historical fantasy, a re-litigating of King’s younger years — go back in time and prevent John F. Kennedy from getting assassinated and prevent Vietnam, man. The JFK assassination (and to a lesser extent, the 1966 Charles Whitman sniper shooting) has popped up again and again in King’s work. As he writes in his memoir/writing manual On Writing, “Ever since John F. Kennedy was shot in Dallas, the great American bogeyman has been the guy with the rifle in a high place.” So it’s not surprising that he would focus an entire book on the event. It’s a very good historical novel, full of convincing era details and fond affection for sixties America. As often happens with King, the book turns into a small-town portrait for a time before delivering an honest-to-God suspenseful third act. </p>
<p> 23. The Green Mile: Taking after Charles Dickens, King decided to try to release a serial novel, in six parts. The challenge? Keep them coming out at regular intervals, have a cliff-hanger at the end of each mini-book, and maintain quality control along the way. He succeeded, and all six books (taken here as one novel) are full of humor and heart. The climax is heartrending, if obvious. “Not long after I began The Green Mile and realized my character was an innocent man likely to be executed for the crime of another, I decided to give him the initials J.C.,” wrote King. “A few critics accused me of being symbolically simplistic … And I’m like, ‘What is this, rocket science? I mean, come on, guys.’ </p>
<p> 22. Hearts in Atlantis: King hasn’t been so successful because he writes well about scary things. No, he’s been so successful because, in addition to that, he also writes about the American Boomer middle class. This volume strings the specter and consequences of the Vietnam War — that generation’s great conflict and shame — throughout a series of interconnected novellas and short stories. “You lost your innocence when you grew up, everyone knew that,” says one character. “But did you have to lose your hope as well?” </p>
<p> 21. Night Shift: King’s first collection of short stories, released in 1978, is packed with satisfying, pulpy tales like “The Boogeyman” (which has an incredible shocker of an ending), “Gray Matter” (about, seriously, an alien beer that mutates a man) and both a prequel and sequel to ’Salem’s Lot. </p>
<p> 20. Roadwork: “Stephen King has always understood that the good guys don’t always win, but he also understands that mostly they do,” writes King in his essay “The Importance of Being Bachman.” Basically, King generally likes to end his novels on an up note, and Bachman, the opposite. Those endings are dark. Take this book, in which a city decides to build a new highway that will require the destruction of one man’s job and home. He decides to fight back, in his own little way, but as we all know, bureaucracies can be the scariest kind of monsters — unyielding, single-minded, and unfeeling. </p>
<p> 19. The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three: The “drawing” of the title refers not to an artist’s sketch, but rather the picking, as if from a deck of cards, of three people to accompany the hero on his multi-book journey to the Dark Tower. There is incident to spare, but King focuses primarily on sketching out character — he seems to know that he’s going to be with these people for years to come and wants to figure them out along with us. </p>
<p> 18. The Talisman: There is a beautiful little passage late in this book in which its main character, Jack Sawyer, looks into a magical object and sees glimpses of other worlds all at once. It’s a moment indicative of the story’s expansiveness. Written by King and friend Peter Straub, The Talisman is a good old sprawling adventure epic: a young man must make his away across two worlds (one Tolkein-esque) in order to save his dying mother. With classic villains and heroes, comic relief and moments of savagery, it’s worth revisiting in these fantasy-obsessed times. </p>
<p> 17. Dolores Claiborne: Impressive as both an exercise in form and voice, this 1993 novel is one long monologue. No chapters. Just one long story as told by the title character, who is being interrogated in the death of the old lady who employed her as a housekeeper. Underrated on account of its slow, unspooling plot, it’s nonetheless one of the more impressive things King’s ever written. </p>
<p> 16: From a Buick 8: Speaking of underrated, this late career tale of a mysterious car whose trunk leads into another dimension contains some of King’s most hard to shake descriptions of things from the unknown. Along with The Colorado Kid, Buick 8 also tries to argue that good stories don’t always have satisfying endings. Such a thing is a “childish insistence.” </p>
<p> 15. Pet Sematary: “Death was, except for childbirth, the most natural thing in the world,” says the doctor at the center of this book. Still, there is never anything natural about the way death is handled in King’s novels, and this might be the most death-obsessed of the bunch. When a doctor discovers an ancient Indian burial ground, he starts to put dead things there (his cat, his son). They don’t stay dead for long. Parents, all too aware of the fragility of their young children, might find this book scariest of all. </p>
<p> 14. The Dark Tower I: The Gunslinger: The book that kicked off the entire saga contains one of King’s most evocative sentences. It also happens to be the first line: “The man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed.” A mash-up of Western, fantasy, and horror, The Gunslinger features some of King’s straight-up weirdest scenes — witness the moment when a man is brought back from the dead. That one will stick around for a long time. </p>
<p> 13. Skeleton Crew: King’s second short-story collection shows a range that most authors of any genre would be incapable of achieving. There’s the requisite gross-out tale (“Survivor Type,” in which a man marooned on a desert isle starts to eat himself bit by bit), an ambitious novella (The Mist), and a sweet piece about an old lady and the way in which she decides to leave this world (“The Reach”). Dude even throws two poems in for good measure. </p>
<p> 12. Under the Dome: A pulp concept (one day an invisible dome appears around a small Maine town, trapping everyone inside and keeping all others out) complicated by a boatload of modern-day concerns — Iraq, waterboarding, Katrina, Obama, Bush, meth, the environment, the far-right. An ambitious work and one of the author’s most political books. </p>
<p> 11. Lisey’s Story: A novel unlike any other in the King catalogue. It is a terrifying leap of imagination for King — the story concerns the widow of a famous writer. And yes, there’s some otherworldly stuff that goes on here, but the book is most concerned with the secret language that develops in any long relationship. Full of memories and flashback and internal dialogue and exhortations shouted out to empty rooms, this is one book that’ll never be made into a crappy movie. </p>
<p> 10. Danse Macabre: An early eighties nonfiction work in which King dissects the many forms of scary books and movies. A dense read, it is nonetheless catnip for anyone who has ever cared a whit about horror. </p>
<p> 9. The Dead Zone: This book about a man cursed with the ability to see the future is many things — a psychic chiller, a serial-killer novel, a political thriller — but what lingers the most is the main character, Johnny Smith. There is a sense of melancholy around him that cannot be found elsewhere in the King universe. </p>
<p> 8. ’Salem’s Lot: It remains one of the best vampire books ever written. An update of Dracula (bloodsucker arrives in town from abroad, wreaks havoc) crossed with the small-town drama of Peyton Place, ’Salem’s Lot showed that the fears and myths of the fusty past could easily exist in the modern wor </p>
<p> 7. The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass: This prequel tells the story of a young Roland, his first great adventure and his first (possibly only) true romance. It’s an incredibly well-told tale, one that aches with a sense of young love other authors could only fantasize about writing. </p>
<p> 6. Misery: Originally meant to be a Bachman book, with all the darkness those books are known for, this tight thriller somehow makes a popular writer’s greatest fear (getting kidnapped by an insane fan) our greatest fear, if only temporarily. Annie Wilkes, writer Paul Sheldon’s “number-one fan,” is one of King’s most hilarious, batshit crazy creations. </p>
<p> 5. Different Seasons: Four novellas: Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, Apt Pupil, The Body, The Breathing Method. Three of them are utter knockouts. (Not coincidentally, all three of those were made into good to great films — you know The Body as Stand by Me.) There’s not a ghost or demon in the bunch, just great characters and frightening portraits of humanity. </p>
<p> 4. The Shining: If ‘Salem’s Lot is the great modern vampire novel, then The Shining is the great modern haunted house book. It may be a while since you’ve read it, and the name may conjure up only the images from Stanley Kubrick’s film, so iconic are they. But drip into it again and you’ll see why the book holds up. In addition to being one of his most frightening (the lady in Room 217!!), it’s also one of King’s most personal works — the story of an alcoholic writer and the havoc he wreaks upon his small family. </p>
<p> 3. IT: One of King’s biggest books, both literally and figuratively. He throws everything he’s got in this one. Concerned with a group of kids who have to fight off an evil, alien child killer, IT is about the essence of fear, the mysterious nature of small towns, the 1950s and movie monsters. King’s wisest book about the dangers and joys of childhood (of which he wrote much in his early years), it also contains more scares per chapter than anything he wrote before or since. </p>
<p> 2. On Writing: These days, it seems as if there are more people writing than ever before. Self published e-books, blogs, Twitter, Facebook — from long to short, everyone fancies themselves a writer with something to say. Which is why King’s On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft is so essential. The first half of the book is a mini-memoir, evocative, funny and matter of fact (“I was built with a love of the night and the uniquet coffin, that’s all. If you disapprove, I can only shrug my shoulders. It’s what I have.”). The second half is a writing manual (a new Strunk and White of sorts) that is practical as hell. It goes through the tools that all writers must effectively employ — vocabulary, grammar, narration, description, dialogue, character, pace, themes — and offers one absolutely essential lesson: “If you don’t have the time to read, you don’t have the time or the tools to write.” Make the time to read this one. </p>
<p> 1. The Stand: One might think it amazing that Stephen King’s tale of a superflu that wipes out 99 percent of the United States still looms so large over all other post-apocalyptic works, so often have the subgenre’s tropes been used in fiction and film. But the author’s sprawling work (which he expanded by 400 pages in an edition released a dozen years after his original) operates on the grandest of scales, literally a battle between good and evil, between God and something like the Devil. The book’s heroes, villains and individual moments are so well written that they remain some of the more memorable in all of late 20th century popular fiction. And while King has said, “There’s something a little depressing about such a united opinion that you did your best work twenty years ago,” we have trouble being down on something so great. </p>

<p> Born in Portland in the year 1947, Stephen King is an American author who is known for his works in supernatural fiction, fantasy, science fiction, suspense and contemporary horror. Many of his books have served as an inspiration for creating a number of feature films, TV shows and comic books. He has written 54 novels so far, including 6 non-fiction, and 200 short stories available in the form of book collections. </p>
<p> Born and brought up in Maine, most of his writings are based in these locations only. Some of his most notable writings include ‘The Way Station’, ‘The Man in the Black Suit’, ‘The Dark Tower’ series, etc. He has been the winner of some of the most prestigious awards, including the Bram Stoker Awards, O. Henry Award, World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement and Grand Master Award from the Mystery Writers of America. </p>
<p> Parents </p>
<p> Stephen King’s mother, Nellie Ruth, was a caregiver in a mental institute, and his father, Donald Edwin King, was a merchant seaman. His father’s surname was ‘Pollock’, but he used ‘King’ as his last name, and so did Stephen. He started earning money by writing and submitting short stories in Cavalier, a men’s magazine at that time. </p>
<p> Spouse </p>
<p> He married Tabitha Jane Spruce on January 2, 1971, who herself is an American activist and author. She proved to be a great inspiration for him for his writing works. Sometimes, Stephen felt discouraged to write, but it was Tabitha who gave him confidence to continue. </p>
<p> She is the daughter of Raymond George Spruce and Sarah Jane Spruce, and has published 2 non-fiction works and 8 novels so far. Her most notable works include ‘Small World’ and ‘Candles Burning’. She has been awarded a number of honors, including the Dowd Achievement Award, Honorary Doctorates of Humane Letters from the University of Maine in Orono and Constance H. Carlson Public Humanities Prize. </p>
<p> Children </p>
<p> Stephen King has 3 children: Naomi King (1970), Joe King (1972) and Owen King (1977). Naomi is minister for Unitarian Universalist Church of River of Grass, Plantation, Florida. Before that, she was involved in restaurant business, and also worked as a gay activist. She has been awarded Stewardship Sermon Award for ‘Stand By This Faith’, her sermon. </p>
<p> Joe King, better known as Joe Hill, is also an American comic writer and author. He has written 3 novels so far, along with 20th Century Ghosts, a short stories collection. Stephen’s youngest son, Owen King is also an author with notable works of ‘We’re All in This Together’ and Double Feature’. </p>
<p> Owen King is married to Kelly Braffet, who is also an acclaimed author of fiction, including ‘Save Yourself’, ‘Last Seen Leaving’, and ‘Josie and Jack’. Stephen King has 4 grand children, and owns three houses in Bangor, Lovell and Sarasota. The Sarasota property is a waterfront mansion situated off the Gulf of Mexico. </p>
<p> While he was going to college my brother Dave worked summers as a janitor at Brunswick High. For part of one summer I worked there, too. One day I was supposed to scrub the rust-stains off the walls in the girls' shower. I noticed that the showers, unlike those in the boys' locker room, had chrome U-rings with pink plastic curtains attached. </p>
<p> This memory came back to me one day while I was working in the laundry, and I started seeing the opening scene of a story: girls showering in a locker room where there were no U-rings, pink plastic curtains or privacy. And this one girl starts to have her period. Only she doesn't know what it is, and the other girls – grossed out, horrified, amused – start pelting her with sanitary napkins … The girl begins to scream. All that blood! </p>
<p> I'd read an article in LIFE magazine some years before, suggesting that at least some reported poltergeist activity might actually be telekinetic phenomena – telekinesis being the ability to move objects just by thinking about them. There was some evidence to suggest that young people might have such powers, the article said, especially girls in early adolescence, right around the time of their first — </p>
<p> POW! Two unrelated ideas, adolescent cruelty and telekinesis, came together, and I had an idea … </p>
<p> Before I had completed two pages, ghosts of my own began to intrude; the ghosts of two girls, both dead, who eventually combined to become Carrie White. I will call one of them Tina White and the other Sandra Irving. </p>
<p> Tina went to Durham Elementary School with me. There is a goat in every class, the kid who is always left without a chair in musical chairs, the one who winds up wearing the KICK ME HARD sign, the one who stands at the end of the pecking order. This was Tina. Not because she was stupid (she wasn't), and not because her family was peculiar (it was) but because she wore the same clothes to school every day. </p>
<p> Sandra Irving lived about a mile-and-a-half from the house where I grew up. Mrs Irving hired me one day to help her move some furniture … I was struck by the crucifix hanging in the living room, over the Irving couch. If such a gigantic icon had fallen when the two of them were watching TV, the person it fell on would almost certainly have been killed. </p>
<p> I did three single-spaced pages of a first draft, then crumpled them up in disgust and threw them away. </p>
<p> The next night, when I came home from school, my wife Tabby had the pages. She'd spied them while emptying my waste-basket, had shaken the cigarette ashes off the crumpled balls of paper smoothed them out and sat down to read them. She wanted me to go on. She wanted to know the rest of the story. </p>
<p> • This piece is taken from Stephen King's book On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft and his Introduction to Carrie. It has been abridged by his British editor. </p>
<p> Forward </p>
<p> This article was published in July 1987 for "The Highway Patrolman" magazine. I interviewed Stephen King while I was a radio talk show host in Texas in the late 1970s. This article is based on a transcript of that radio program. Stephen is still writing as of 2005. He is one of the best selling authors of all time. I have added a few recent comments, which will appear in blue text. </p>
<p> "Stephen King in 2003" </p>
<p> "An Interview with Stephen King" by Phil Konstantin </p>
<p> ...and now, here is the article exactly as it appeared in 1987 (including the punctuation)... </p>
<p> Stephen King is the unabashed king of the terror tale. For the last 10 years, his stories have consistantly appeared on every best seller list. On many occasions, he has even had two books simultaniously on the prestigious New York Times best seller list. His stories range from the ghastly and the unworldly, to the realm of near truth and the terrifyingly possible. </p>
<p> He has scared the wits out of millions and has firmly established himself in modern American literature. Some of his writings include: Carrie, Salem's Lot, Night shift (a collection of short stories), The Stand, The Shining, Firestarter, Cujo, Dead Zone, Creep Show, Christine and Pet Sematary. Many of his novels have become major motion pictures, with Dead Zone, Christine and Carrie being three of his more popular cinematic offerings. </p>
<p> King lives in Maine with his wife and children. He enjoys the "life of the back woods," as he calls it. King writes about what he knows, consequently, many of his stories are set in his "own neck of the woods." </p>
<p> King is very frank and open, and displays a corny sense of humor. (We share this sense of humor) He enjoys his work and takes a great deal of pride in it. When asked if he was a storyteller, he said he didn't think he could keep an audience spellbound just by telling them a story. But, in his description of the facts behind one of his short stories, The Mangler, as told below, you will see how well endowed he is with the ability to raise the hackles on your neck with only a brief narration. </p>
<p> I understand you don't like to be asked why you write the kind of stories you do. Is this correct? I have always felt a little bit uncomfortable with that question. It's not a question that you would ask a guy that writes detective stories or the guy that writes mystery stories, or westerns, or whatever. But it is asked of the writer of horror stories because it seems that there is something nasty about our love for horror stories, or boogies, ghosts and goblins, demons and devils. </p>
<p> When did you start writing? I started writing seriously when I was about 12. </p>
<p> Do you have to be in a special mood to start writing? I am always in the mood. </p>
<p> Do you have a certain method that you use when you write? It usually is a set schedule. I write in the mornings, in the bright daylight. But I get most of my good ideas after the sun has gone down and the dark is on the land. (It is this type of turn of a phrase that has made King's writing so poular) </p>
<p> Do you consider what you write "horror stories?" There are times when I like to think of it as mainstream fiction or literature. But in the back of my mind, in the closet where I keep the truth, I think of them as horror stories. A lot of them I think of as creep shows. (A few years after this interview, Stephen wrote a script for a movie by George Romero. That movie was titled "Creep Show.") </p>
<p> I once read that Salem's Lot is your favorite book. Why? In a way it is my favorite story, mostly because of what it says about small towns. They are kind of a dying organism right now. The story seems sort of down home to me. I have a special cold spot in my heart for it! </p>
<p> Is the town of Jerusalem's Lot (Salem's Lot) a real town? Yes and no. It is based on a town in upstate Vermont, that I heard about as an undergraduate in college, called Jeremiah's Lot. I was going through Vermont with a friend and he pointed out the town, just in passing, as we went by in the car. He said, "You know, they say that everybody in that town just simply disappeared in 1908." I said, "Aw, come on. What are you talking about?" He said, "That's the story. Haven't you heard of the Marie Celest where everybody supposedly disappeared? This is the same thing. One day they were there and then one day a relative came over to look for someone that they hadn't heard from in awhile; and all of the houses were empty. Some of the houses had dinner set on the table. Some of the stores still had money in them. It was covered in mold from the summer damp and it was starting to rot, but nobody had stolen it. The town was completely emptied out." </p>
<p> Is that how you get inspiration for your stories, or does it also come from day-to-day events, a phrase you may hear, or even from suggestions you get from fans? I get inspiration, a lot of times, from very commonplace things that just strike a chord and develop themselves in the subconscious. Sometimes it's something a little bit more sensational than that. As an example, there is a story in the book Night Shift, called 'The Mangler,' about a laundry machine that takes on a sort of malignant life. I worked in a laundry for about a year and a half after I got out of college. It was the only job I could find to support my wife and our first child. There was a fellow there that had no hands or forearms. He simply had hooks. This is one of the things that they don't tell you about when you become management. You have to wear a tie. It was this fellow's tie that did him in. </p>
<p> It was just after World War II and he was working around the machines. The steam ironer and folder is the machine the workers call the Mangler, because that is what it will do to you if you get too close to it or get caught in it. This fellow bent down to pick something up and his tie went into the machine. He reached down with his left hand to pull his tie out and his hand went into the machine. Then he put his right hand around his left wrist to try to pull it out and his right hand got caught. As a result, he lost both hands and forearms and was lucky not to have died. His hands were replaced by hooks. (And people wonder why I don't like ties!) </p>
<p> Thirty years later, when I worked there, he would go into the men's room, during the summer and turn on the hot and cold water and run it over the hooks. He would then come up behind you and lay the hooks on the back of your neck. That's what gave me the inspiration for that particular story. I always think of the machine at the end of the story, which sort of becomes possessed by a demon and escapes from the laundry and goes through the streets, as sort of having escaped because it had "pressing business." </p>
<p> Since you mention Night Shift, how is it that John D. MacDonald came to do the introduction? His field is so far from your own. When we were putting the book together for Doubleday, my editor asked me who I would like to do the introduction if I could have anyone in the world. I said that it was off the wall, but if I could have anybody I would like to have John D. MacDonald because I had cut my teeth on his stories. I still think that of all the people doing top fiction today, he is the best. He was my model as a kid. If there are people out there that want to write, all you need to do is read 20 of his stories to get an idea what it takes to make a story kick over. </p>
<p> Would you ever participate in a seance? I would NOT participate in one under any circumstances. Not even if my wife died and a medium said she had a message from my wife. I cannot conceive of circumstances under which I would participate in that sort of thing or stay overnight in a house that was reputed to be haunted or any of those things. We are too close as it is to a world that is incomprehensible. And the time comes when you and I and everyone who walks the face of this earth has to enter that world. We will know then, and I can wait. </p>
<p> Are you interested in psychics, ESP and similar areas? I am interested in it and I think now in the latter half of the twentieth century we have enough documentation so that anyone that doubts the psychic experience is an actual empiric reality is on the level with a person who continues to smoke two or three packs of cigarettes a day and denies that there is a link between smoking and lung cancer. The documentation is there. It can barely be questioned any further. We have as much proof, furthermore, barring some technological development that does not exist now, as we are ever going to have. It is simply the preponderance of evidence; it precludes the doubt almost entirely. </p>
<p> What is your personal feeling about reincarnation? I don't believe in it. I don't like the idea that I am going to come back as an ant or a sparrow if I don't get along in the great karma of life. As far as where I go when I die, the concept that I am simple going to flick out, like a light bulb, to me is not only spiritually impossible to believe, but logically it is laughable -- the idea that we simply die and nothing happens. Now, as to what does go on, that is something else. I am religious in the sense that I believe in God and I believe that there is an abiding logical spirit that controls what goes on to a certain extent. Now, there is the Watchmaker Theory that God wound up the universe and let it tick. That may be. or it may be that he takes a hand in things from time to time. But whatever it is, I am sure that there is something out there. </p>
<p> In your own experience have you ever come across any ghosts, ghoulies or anything that goes bump in the night? No. </p>
<p> Do you get letters from people that say they have actually experienced things like what you write about? Yes, I got letters from people that have had peculiar psychic experiences, experiences with the dead -- sometimes fairly tranquil experiences and sometimes very terrifying experiences. I do believe that a lot of them are sincere. I do believe, also, that some of them may be misguided. But, I think the majority of them have experienced something. This is something that you and I may stumble over like a stone in our paths at any time in our lives. I think everybody has experiences from time to time they can't explain. They are peculiarities. Usually we just dismiss them because they are uncomfortable to think about. </p>
<p> As a child, did you read horror stories and go to see horror movies? Sometimes. Semi-facetiously, when people ask me why I write these kinds of stories, I simply say that I was warped as a child. And, there is some truth to that. The first movie I can remember seeing was The Creature From The Black Lagoon. And, I can remember hearing a radio play of Ray Bradbury's Mars Is Heaven. And when I cut my teeth on comic books, they were not the easy ones of today like Spiderman, Superman and The Hulk. they were Tales Of The Crypt, The Vaultkeeper, and that sort of thing. </p>
<p> What do you think of the new wave in horror films such as Night Of The Living Dead and Dawn Of The Dead which deal with a great deal of violence? The Night Of The Living Dead is an interesting case because it was an unrated movie when it came out. At that time there were only two ratings: GP, which is the same as PG now, and the unrated movies. I was still in college when Night Of The Living Dead came out, and when I went to see it the first time, I went in the afternoon. The place was full of kids, mostly from five to eleven. I have never in my life, from the time I was a kid until now, been in an audience where children were so quiet. They were sitting gape-mouthed; they were simply stunned. Total silence. It was the best argument for the rating system that I have ever seen. I don't have anything against either of the Dead movies, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, none of those movies. If it scares somebody, I think that it is serving a valid purpose. It is doing what the filmmaker intended. But, it is not something that you hand to kids. You just don't do it. You have to be old enough to take it. Kids are just not prepared for it. I think most of us can remember from our own childhood, just in the Disney cartoons, things that frightened us profoundly. For me it was Bambi, the scene when the forest was on fire. That was something I had nightmares about. I can't imagine being a little kid of eight and seeing Night Of The Living Dead with living corpses eating the flesh of living people. </p>
<p> How faithfully have your stories been transferred to the screen? Well, let's take Carrie for example. Brian De Palma, who directed the film, did an excellent job on a fairly low budget. It was made for about $2.3 million, which is peanuts for the movie industry. But, for instance, when Stanley Kubrick made The Shining, they wound up spending about $14 million, which IS big money (1970s dollars). In the book Carrie, Carrie ends up destroying her entire town on the way home from her senior prom. She blows up gas stations, and the entire town goes up in flames. That wasn't in the movie, and that was mainly because the cost from the special effects was too high for their budget. </p>
<p> Do you have much control of your material when it comes to supervising movies? No. And I wouldn't want it because I'm a person that writes books. I don't make movies. I don't feel that I have to have artistic control. Part of this comes from the fact that the book lives on no matter what Hollywood does to your novel in terms of a film. Now, you try to be careful who you allow to do your film because nobody wants their novel to become a turkey movie. But, on the other hand, it is a crapshot anyway, because even the best people can make a bad film. (In 1986, Stephen would change his mind. He wrote and directed the movie Maximum Overdrive. It was far from a critical success, but remains a cult favorite. </p>
<p> Do you actually believe in the things you write about? I believe them when I write about them. Whether or not I believe them when I an not writing them is something else. I think that a good part of me must or I couldn't do it with any kind of conviction. </p>
<p> Quite a few of your stories deal with average people beset by great difficulties, and, in essence, you are dealing with human nature. Are you trying to be philosophical? I don't really get philosophical, but I believe that nice people are strong and usually in my horror stories, I don't like to write about the old standard where some rotten guy gets chased by a mean spirit that gets him in the end. I'd rather write about nice people that are menaced from outside by some sort of evil power and who sort of slug it out like Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali (former heavyweight champion boxers). And I like to think that good people win. But even good people have other sides. Most people will slow down to get a good look at an accident, even though they won't admit it (I joke that this was why I was a CHP officer). I think most of us are fascinated by the macabre and by the weird and even the nastiness that comes along. </p>
<p> Do you really end your stories or do you just stop them at some point in time? I've never been asked that before. Well, sometimes there is a place where you can tie the story up with a neat twist. And then there are other stories, like a story of mine called Truck. You come to a place where you can end the story, but in the back of your mind, you're convinced that there are other things to tell but the time is not right to tie things off. </p>
<p> Do you think it is important to keep your readers guessing? Yes. This is a form that has become probably less critically popular as time has gone by. I like to end stories where the readers have a little room to run. They can resolve things as they like in their own mind. </p>
<p> Which do you like better, short stories or novels? I like to write short stories more because I never met a writer who wasn't lazy. And a short story is, by its very definition, short. It is something that generally you can turn out in a week to two weeks depending on how well it goes for you. But, at the same time, it gives the same satisfaction of creating a complete world. </p>
<p> Since many of your stories deal with the supernatural, have you ever felt in any physical or spiritual peril from such beings? To my soul, I'm not so sure about. As far as my physical being is concerned, so far so good. I simply think that there are things in this world that are relics. We have unsettling remnants of Atlantis. They have found things off Bermuda, great walls and things of that sort. This seems to indicate that there were races and cultures that went before us. And to me, that's an unsettling idea. </p>
<p> Some people say that horror stories are just cheap shots. All you have to do is write a very simple story, put in a lot of blood and guts, and have somebody do something nasty to someone else; and that's it. What do you think? It doesn't work like that. Scaring people, especially in our day and time, is one of the hardest things on earth, as far as I am concerned. You and I and everyone else in this world live in what is probably the most difficult times that have ever been. We are facing total thermonuclear destruction; and, if you can make someone believe in a ghost or a demon or a vampire in the face of that, you are doing well. From my own personal point of view, I don't think just blood and guts is enough. At least, it isn't for me. Maybe it will turn someone's stomach; but, I'm not sure that is literature or even entertainment. </p>
<p> A friend once told me that she actually had to put one of your stories down because the imagery that she had built up in her mind "grossed her out." Would you consider that a compliment? Yeah, I would. I'm not a purist in this field. My feeling of the whole genre, of the terror tale, is this: The best thing that you can do for the readers in this field is to terrify them. That's a head reaction. It is something that is intellectual, it happens in your mind. It is the sort of effect that Edgar Allen Poe gets in his story, The Telltale Heart, when he starts talking about a quick beating sound, like a watch. There is something about that that appeals to the mind more than anything else. The fact that this fellow is hearing the heart, the dismembered heart under the floorboard beating and beating, and the police are there and nobody can hear it but him. It goes on and on and it gets louder and louder. That's terror! </p>
<p> And then there is horror, that's the next step on the ladder. It is a physical sort of reaction. It is the reaction you have to the idea that a machine could literally, physically come alive and want to suck people in and grind them up. That is a horrible thought. And then you finally get down to the literal, physical "gross out," which is probably the basest human emotion that we know. But still, it is valid and we have a need for it. If I can't get terror, and I can't get horror, I'll be happy with a "gross out." </p>
<p> Do you enjoy reading other people's horror stories? Oh, yes. There are a lot of people in the field that I do read. There is a lot of stuff that is written in this field, though, that is not very good. You just have to look for the good stuff. </p>
<p> Which is harder to write, a story that appeals to the intellect or one that hits you at the gut level? I think it is harder to write a story that appeals to the intellect. But, when you tie onto one, you can do it quite deeply. It really depends on the type of idea you have to begin with. </p>
<p> You have written several stories about rats. Do you have a certain fascination with them? I write about things that scare me. I've never written a snake story in my life. I rwad a good one called Mountain King awhile back; but, I myself have never written a story about snakes because they don't scare me. I write about rats because they scare the hell out of me. I think we tend to write out our phobias. </p>
<p> Have you had a subject that you have wanted to write about but have never been able to do it? Spiders! I want to write about spiders. To me, this is the one theme that cuts right across and scares just about everybody. Spiders, to me, are just about the most horrible, awful things that I can think about. I think everyone is afraid of spiders. I have also wanted to write a really good elevator story about the fear of heights. A stuck-in-the-elevator story can combine a fear of heights and also claustrophobia. </p>
<p> With the tremendous explosion of technological advances, do you see a time when fact will far surpass any kind of fiction you can conceive? Yes. I think we are getting into that situation now. One of the examples I use is abortion on demand. The Supreme Court has said that abortion on demand is legal up until the third month of term. Which means for the first twelve or fourteen weeks of a woman's pregnancy, she can abort her fetus. That is her determination. The Supreme Court has said that that is not a human being with its own right to life. The problem is this, we're approaching a point where a fetus of three months, two months or even one month can be kept alive. Which is to say that you have to question the mother's ability to say, "It's my property; it's a part of me. It isn't a living thing on its own." Science is beginning to encroach on every level of our volition. And to me, that is a frightening social concept. It doesn't have anything to do with the right to have an abortion verses the right to life. It has to do with the ability of science to keep things alive and the ability of science to really control our lives. </p>

<p> Stephen King Knows He’s Having a Moment </p>
<p> The versatile author gets candid about the seven (!) King adaptations that will hit the screen in the next few months, from It to Castle Rock to The Dark Tower. </p>
<p> Is it fair to say that Stephen King is having a moment if he’s never quite stopped having a moment? The famously prolific writer—author of dozens of books (seven under the pen name Robert Bachman)—has 238 “based on the original story by” writer credits on IMDb, spanning the course of 41 years. </p>
<p> So perhaps it’s more statistical inevitability than anything else that over the next few months, five Stephen King adaptations will be out simultaneously: three on television (The Mist, Mr. Mercedes, Castle Rock) and two in theaters (It and The Dark Tower). “There’s also a couple of Netflix films,” King tells me: “Gerald’s Game and 1922. But I think those will be later this year.” </p>
<p> “People often forget the breadth of Stephen’s work and therefore the resulting breath of adaptations,” says Akiva Goldsman, who produced the Dark Tower film—out Friday—and is one of four writers to which its screenplay is attributed. “We think of Stephen often as a horror author, but that is still sort of the ghetto-ization of the genre, and the relegation of a pretty terrific literary artist. Everything from Misery to Stand by Me to Shawshank, and The Green Mile—these are seminal mainstream objects that are based on his work. Stephen King movies have been around a lot longer than people have been aware that they are Stephen King movies.” </p>
<p> And with the bottomless need for original content on all platforms, King’s works—his novels and countless short stories—provide reliable fodder for satisfying, well-told narratives, a rich vein for Hollywood to mine when comic-book adaptations have run stale and all of the ideas that can be gleaned from staring at one’s iPhone have been attempted. </p>
<p> “My first editor, Bill Thompson, used to tell people Stephen King has a projector in his head, and that might have something to do with certain visual elements of the stories that have attracted producers and directors,” King says over the phone. (Like many of his characters, the author lives in Maine). “Again, Dana, I’m probably not the right person to ask. I’m inside it. I just write the stories.” </p>
<p> The glut of King content could also be attributed to a culture that’s finally caught up with Stephen King. Thanks to decades of torture porn and gory prestige TV, the bar for shocking content has been raised past the point of King’s famously macabre imagination; it’s no wonder, then, that film and television are no longer shying away from even his most disturbing material. Take the innocuous-sounding Gerald’s Game, which centers around a wife stranded in a remote cabin after her husband playfully handcuffs her to the bed, then dies of a heart attack. Her escape effort involves broken glass and blood as lubricant. King wrote the novel in 1992; the film wasn’t shot until 2016. </p>
<p> The upcoming adaptation of It is a much more high-profile example. “My only requirement was that they go ahead and try to do as much of the novel as they could, which meant an R rating,” King says. Compared to 1990’s TV miniseries featuring Tim Curry as the terrifying Pennywise the Clown, the new movie is “more balls to the wall. The first one was true enough to the book, and its heart was certainly in the right place, but TV is a hurry-up medium, and the budget is a little bit on the low side . . . and in the 80s, there were a lot of things you can’t do on TV. You weren’t supposed to show children in jeopardy on TV, and that’s what It’s all about.” </p>
<p> Of course, TV itself has also gotten much darker since the 80s, making it the perfect landscape for a King invasion. In 2007, King’s novella The Mist was adapted into a single two-hour movie; a decade later, it’s taken new form as a 10-episode series on Spike. And Mr. Mercedes, a nuanced and addicting show premiering August 9 on the Audience network, is perhaps TV’s most pleasant King surprise—especially coming from an AT&T-owned channel that’s had very few tentpole series. Well, it’s “pleasant” in a Stephen King sort of way: the show centers around the psychopathic Brady Hartsfield, who drives a Mercedes into a crowd, and years later taunts the retired policeman who was unable to catch him. </p>
<p> The novel features many elements that recur in King’s work: abusive mother figures, distinct deaths, the sinister hiding in the innocuous (Brady works in an ice-cream truck). For a novel written in 2014, it also seems surprisingly prescient; at the climax of the book, Brady plants a bomb at a pop concert for an audience of teenage girls, similar to the recent terror attack in Manchester. “It’s more of a town gala-city fair thing, which took some of the edge off how weird the mirroring of the timing was,” says Harry Treadaway, who plays Brady. </p>
<p> For Treadaway, who previously played the similarly morbid Dr. Frankenstein in Showtime’s Penny Dreadful, researching his character meant a crash course in “dark, dark stuff.” </p>
<p> “He is an abuse victim of his mother, and I think that’s what makes [the character] three-dimensional, and that’s deeply in the book. You can vaguely see the roots of his evil: that’s what makes Stephen King’s book so interesting. It was a strange process of reading the book and then trying to get under the skin of him, and trying to empathize with someone who has no empathy.” </p>
<p> King has an executive-producer credit on Mr. Mercedes, but he doesn’t share the same title on Castle Rock—a Hulu series produced by J.J. Abrams in which a dozen or so King stories combine in a single fictional universe, set in the author’s favorite imaginary Maine town. But while the author says he has zero involvement with the show, he thinks Castle Rock is in good hands: “I know J.J. I knew his work from Lost, and we spend some time kicking stuff around, and I just really liked the guy.” Abrams ended up adapting King’s Kennedy assassination novel 11.22.63 for Hulu; “it was terrific, and so why wouldn’t I do it with him again? He’s a good guy.” </p>
<p> Although the single-volume books Mr. Mercedes and The Mist have provided enough material for full television series, the massive Dark Tower series—beginning in 1982 and spanning over 4,000 pages—notoriously eluded adaptation until this year, when a Dark Tower film is finally hitting theaters. With a budget of $66 million and two A-List actors headlining—Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey—it’s perhaps the highest-profile King project this year. </p>
<p> King’s massive, multiverse-spanning books have ignited a particularly dedicated fan base. “They’ve always been a smaller and more dedicated cadre than the people who read the other books,” King says. “The Dark Tower fans are rather to the point where they show up in autograph lines and they’ve got tattoos on their body—of the Dark Tower, or Roland, or guns, or whatever it is. So sure, I want the movie to please them, and I don’t know if it will or not. But I always say, if you don’t like it—and I do—go on back and read the book again, because you can’t change that, so. But like I say, you just have to see what happens. I think they made a hell of a movie.” So far, critics seem to disagree; the film is currently hovering at 19 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. Their main complaint is that the film dilutes King’s massive fantasy universe, losing the surreally epic quality that made the book series such a cult favorite. What’s left isn’t enough of the books to please the fans, and is too confusing to serve as an introduction for the unindoctrinated. (Vanity Fair critic Richard Lawson called it “the rare bad movie that should be longer.”) </p>
<p> The film also seems to be missing what makes King’s stories resonate so fiercely: whether they’re about murderers or magicians, these tales are most successful when they operate in the space between nostalgia and terror. King’s protagonists are almost always ordinary—or at least recognizable, people from small towns who are thrust face-to-face against the worst horrors of humanity and the paranormal. And at a time when entertainment is saturated with superhero stories that have blended together into a single amalgam of quips and explosions, King’s bibliography stands apart as a bottomless well of perfectly crafted, macabre fairy tales in which the battle between good and evil is far closer to earth—for the producers and directors who are able to do them justice, anyway. </p>
<p> Just don’t say all of that to Stephen King. “In a way, yeah, it does feel like I’m having a moment, but not anything that I’m trying to get a puffy head about,” he says. “It’s just the way things happen. You sow your seeds, and sometimes they all come up at the same time, and that’s a great thing. It’s my lucky year, Dana; what can I say?” </p>

<p> Stephen King's Books Are All Connected To Each Other, And It's Honestly Terrifying </p>
<p> Clowns lurking in storm drains. Twins at the end of an abandoned hotel hallway. A sad girl covered in blood on prom night. Honestly, it's hard to think of a Stephen King book that hasn't left at least one image permanently scorched into our brains. Stephen King's horror stories scarred many of our childhoods (and adulthoods, for that matter), but the most upsetting thing of all might be that all of King's books are connected. Yes, Shawshank State Prison, the children of the corn, and the lone Gunslinger walking through the desert are all part of one huge, terrifying narrative. Here are just ten of the ways in which all of King's books are connected, and why you should be very, very scared. </p>
<p> Between the new movie of It, the new movie of The Dark Tower, the new movie of Gerald's Game, and several dozen other TV and film adaptations (not to mentions new novels), it seems like Stephen King must run the universe. But that's simply not true: King runs the multiverse. Many of his books share locations and characters across parallel universes, as neatly explained in this flowchart. Or, if you don't have time to follow every line between Annie Wilkes and the Crimson King, here are some of the creepiest connections between King's novels: </p>
<p> Check out the entire What's Up, Boo? series and other videos on Facebook and the Bustle app across Apple TV, Roku, and Amazon Fire TV. </p>
<p> 1. The Man in Black keeps showing up </p>
<p> He goes by Randall Flagg, or Walter o'Dim, or simply the Man in Black. He appears in The Dark Tower books,The Stand, The Eyes of Dragon, 'Salem's Lot, Children of the Corn, and several other King stories. He's never good news. As King's self-described best villain, the Man in Black takes on various forms throughout the multiverse to sow conflict and bring down entire civilizations in service of some even greater evil force. </p>
<p> 2. Pennywise Lives </p>
<p> Pennywise, or "It," is another King villain who spans multiple books and even universes. In Tommyknockers, a character glimpses "a clown with shiny silver dollars for eyes" while driving through Derry, Maine. In Dreamcatcher, someone has spray painted the words "Pennywise Lives" on the standpipe. In 11/22/63, the protagonist asks two of the children from It about a crime in their town, and overhears one say to the other "that wasn't the clown." The creepy character of Dandelo from the Dark Tower books has a lot of Pennywise qualities as well, but King has said that they're not the same character... although they're probably from the same species. So there's an entire species of killer clowns out there. So that's fun. </p>
<p> 3. The Eclipse </p>
<p> This one's not quite as all-encompassing, but two of King's novels hinge on the same solar eclipse. In Gerald's Game and Dolores Claiborne, an eclipse in Maine becomes a major plot point, and the titular Dolores Claiborne senses that Jessie, the protagonist of Gerald's Game, is in some kind of trouble, despite being an entire novel away. </p>
<p> 4. Everyone is from Derry or Castle Rock </p>
<p> Stephen King in famous for setting his stories in Maine, and a lot of those stories center around the fictional towns of Derry and Castle Rock. Even when the book doesn't take place in Derry, Castle Rock, or the surrounding area (like Jerusalem's Lot or Shawshank Prison), chances are that at least one of the characters hails from a small town in Maine that just so happens to be the nexus for ultimate evil. </p>
<p> 5. One character gets a 29 year, 4 book redemption arc </p>
<p> A lot of the characters who crop up in multiple books, like the Man in Black, Pennywise, or the Crimson King, are pretty clearly evil. Father Callahan from 'Salem's Lot gets to redeem himself over the course of several different books, though. After getting bullied by vampires, losing his faith, and leaving the town of Jerusalem's Lot in shame, Callahan heads to New York and pops up in the Dark Tower books, where he gets to stop feeling sorry for himself and help our heroes in their quest to save the multiverse. </p>
<p> 6. The cook from the Overlook Hotel appears in "It" </p>
<p> It's impossible to pick one single scariest King book, but The Shining and It are both top contenders. Dick Hallorann appears in both novels: he was an army cook who lived in Derry, Maine, and used his shining to save the life of Mike Hanlon's father before the events of It. He later took a job as a cook at the Overlook Hotel, where he warned a young Danny Torrance about his "shine." </p>
<p> 7. All nasty things come from “The Macroverse” or “Todash Space” </p>
<p> Almost all of the creepy, supernatural elements in Stephen King's books can be traced back to the mysterious dark reality known as "The Macroverse" or "Todash Space." These two realms seem to be connected, if not one and the same, and they are home to Pennywise, the mist, the deadlights, Cthun, and many more King monsters. </p>
<p> 8. Stephen King is a character </p>
<p> Perhaps the biggest connection between all the Stephen King books is that Stephen King appears in the Stephen King books. He's a character in the Dark Tower series, in which he plays a writer in our world who writes the Dark Tower series. Apparently, King's near-fatal car accident in 1999 was an attempted murder by the Crimson King, but the author was saved by Jake Chambers, one of the protagonists of The Dark Tower. </p>
<p> 9. The Shop is behind it all </p>
<p> The secretive government agency known as The Shop is behind the horror in several of King's novels. The Shop has tapped into Todash Space before with the Arrowhead Project, releasing the mist from The Mist. They experimented with the chemical Lot Six in Firestarter. They appear in Tommyknockers and The Lawnmower Man, and they're mentioned in The Stand. Basically, you don't want to end up involved in one of their "science projects." </p>
<p> 10. Everything connects to the Dark Tower </p>
<p> The Dark Tower stands at the nexus of every universe, and the Dark Tower series serves as the huge, over-arching plot of the King multiverse. You can certainly enjoy his other novels as standalone stories, but since The Dark Tower is a fight for existence itself, it encompasses all of the other stories. As King himself puts it: </p>
<p> I have written enough novels and short stories to fill a solar system of the imagination, but Roland's story is my Jupiter--a planet that dwarfs all the others . . . a place of strange atmosphere, crazy landscape, and savage gravitational pull. Dwarfs the others, did I say? I think there's more to it than that, actually. I am coming to understand that Roland's world (or worlds) actually contains all the others of my making... </p>
<p> Stephen King’s Family Business </p>
<p> Life in Maine, where Stephen King has spent most of his adult years, requires long drives down country roads, time that King, whose mind is restless, likes to fill by listening to books on tape. In the ’80s, however, he sometimes could not find the books he wanted on tape — or maybe he just did not bother. He had three children: Naomi, Joe and Owen. They could read, couldn’t they? All King had to do was press record. Which is how his school-age children came to furnish their father, over the years, with a small library’s worth of books on tape. </p>
<p> On a drizzly morning in July, King, his wife and their children gathered in Maine for a reunion the week of the Fourth and compared notes on what constituted chores in the King household. As they talked, they were crowded around a rather small kitchen table in a lakeside guesthouse, where King’s 41-year-old son, Joe Hill, was staying, a short drive from the family’s summer home. </p>
<p> “I read you that stupid book, that Dean Koontz book,” said Owen King, who is 36 and the youngest of the three children. </p>
<p> “Watch it!” interrupted his father, but Owen, seated across the table from his father, kept going: “The one where the dog is a genius, and he talks to him by pointing at Scrabble pieces with his nose.” </p>
<p> “Hey, I liked that book,” Joe said. </p>
<p> “I loved that book,” their father said. </p>
<p> “I remember reading ‘The Carpetbaggers,’ ” Joe said. “I remember feeling that was a very long novel.” </p>
<p> Tabitha King, their mother, suddenly sat upright. “That’s a filthy book — I didn’t know he would have asked you to read that. How old were you?” </p>
<p> “I don’t know,” Joe said, dodging for his dad. “I was innocent when I started, and I was filthy afterward.” </p>
<p> Owen’s wife, Kelly Braffet, was seated beside her husband. She had heard some of these details before; it was family lore that Naomi, who is 43, was asked to read and record, at age 12, “Raven,” the definitive journalistic account of the Jonestown massacre. “It was horrible,” Naomi said. </p>
<p> Stephen finally rallied in self-defense. “But you read me all those Wilbur Smiths!” he said to Naomi. “And ‘Anna Karenina.’ ” </p>
<p> Entertaining their parents, for the King children, was part job, part enrichment. At bedtime, they were the ones expected to tell their parents stories, instead of the other way around. Whatever their methods or intentions, Stephen and Tabitha’s shared vocation, and their approach to child rearing, has yielded a significant number of successful fiction writers in their household. Tabitha is an accomplished writer with eight novels to her credit, and two of their three children, Joe and Owen, are novelists. (Naomi is a Unitarian Universalist minister.) Joe’s “NOS4A2,” a sprawling mix of horror and fantasy that is his third critically praised best seller, was published last April; Owen’s second work of fiction, a well-received comedic novel titled “Double Feature,” was published in March. Owen, perhaps inevitably, married a writer, Kelly Braffet, whose third novel, a literary thriller called “Save Yourself,” is out this month. And Stephen’s much-anticipated sequel to the “The Shining,” titled “Doctor Sleep,” comes out this fall. </p>
<p> Circus performers, klezmer musicians — those are the kinds of entertainers we usually expect to see in a family business, not writers. There are a few exceptions — children of successful writers who have bravely followed their parents. Martin Amis (son of Kingsley) is perhaps the best-known example, but Rebecca Miller (daughter of Arthur) and Ted Heller (son of Joseph) have also published, more quietly, well-reviewed novels. But for sheer volume of books, cultural impact and accumulated readership, none of those families come close to the Kings. The closest comparison would have to be the Brontës, and even they maxed out at a paltry three published novelists, plus one dissipated poet. </p>
<p> If reading was a common escape in the King household, it was nonetheless deeply social. They read on tape, but they also took turns reading aloud after dinner, passing around “The Hobbit” or the Narnia chronicles. It followed that writing came to feel like something they all could share as well. Stephen and Tabitha did not take themselves off to quiet sheds or off-site offices to write; they wrote in their own home, upstairs, as their kids, below, wondered what words were being put on the page and played elaborate role-playing games of their own. </p>
<p> When the group broke from the conversation around the table to pose for a family photo outside, they continued their easy patter on books and pop culture. Joe’s corgi, McMurtry, named after the novelist Larry McMurtry, was insistently present, so that someone catching snippets, from a distance, of the family’s conversation as they made their way into the yard would have heard something like this: “Neil Gaiman . . . Spielberg . . . McMurtry! McMurtry! . . . Cronenberg . . . Matt Groening . . . McMurtry!” </p>
<p> “Did you see that picture of John Irving that ran somewhere — he was coming out of some swamp with his shirt off?” Owen asked. “He looked like a ninja.” </p>
<p> Then they assembled; they posed, as close to a first family of letters as America is likely to have. </p>
<p> “The last photographer who shot me kept yelling: ‘Love me! Love me!’ ” Stephen said. </p>
<p> “That’s so ‘Zoolander,’ ” Kelly said. </p>
<p> Then: Flash. </p>
<p> KELLY </p>
<p> In 1990, when Kelly Braffet was a high-school freshman in Western Pennsylvania, her parents gave her, for Christmas, a Stephen King book-of-the-month subscription, which came, as she recalls, with a six-inch rubber skeleton — “very creepy.” It was just what she wanted. She was in her “Stephen King completist” phase, and she was trying to track down hardcover copies of his more obscure books. Her completist phase could have been considered officially over 17 years later, when she married Owen, whom she met at the Columbia M.F.A. writing program in 2001. The day they met, Braffet was carrying around a book by John D. MacDonald, a midcentury crime writer who would not be found on their syllabus but was an icon in the King household. She was a suitable girl: a book-loving, book-writing student who was pretty in glasses and had a healthy appreciation for potboilers. He was an easygoing, attentive boyfriend. Once they swapped manuscripts to make sure they did not hate each other’s writing, the relationship quickly moved forward. </p>
<p> Even so, Braffet was nervous about meeting her future in-laws, nervous even at the sound of Stephen King’s voice on Owen’s answering machine. “It took me two years before I could actually speak in front of Steve and Tabby,” she said. </p>
<p> Braffet’s father is an E.M.S. helicopter pilot, and her mother is a computer programmer who attended college late in life. Braffet herself worked two summers in a warehouse, where she “picked stickers off of one piece of paper and put them on another,” a glimpse of her possible future had she not earned a scholarship to Sarah Lawrence College. Her first visit to the King family home, which is in Bangor, was unnerving: all those endless rooms and hallways, like a real-life version of the hotel in “The Shining,” and that crazy, famous fence around their home, with its wrought-iron bats and cobwebs. “Their underground library,” Braffet noted, “was bigger than the entire library in the town I grew up in. It was . . . a lot.” </p>
<p> Eventually, in 2004, while they were waiting to move into a condo in Brooklyn, Kelly and Owen spent six months living near the Kings in Maine, a period in which they saw them virtually every day. Braffet’s nerves clearly calmed. This July, at the Kings’ house, during some downtime, Braffet sat next to one of her childhood idols as he pored over his iPad; he was fully immersed in the video game Jetpack Joyride. </p>
<p> The relationship between Kelly and Stephen has the easy rapport of in-laws relieved to enjoy each other’s company, the conversation light, less likely to turn to the mysterious process of writing than to the end product — either someone else’s work or their own. The Kings’ embrace of her writing is clearly not a function of politeness; they seemed to be competing to outdo themselves in their praise of “Save Yourself” when the subject came up. </p>
<p> “It’s like David Cronenberg adapted an S.E. Hinton novel for David Lynch,” Joe said. </p>
<p> His father jumped in to refine his son’s mash-up description of the book’s tone: “It’s more like James Cain” — another of Stephen’s beloved crime writers — “adapted S.E. Hinton for David Lynch.” </p>
<p> What they did not say, or maybe even notice, is that the book provides a literary, Internet-age update of King’s “Carrie”: a story of savage high-school bullying that ends in a blaze of violence; it includes a vampire-inspired cult but stops short of the supernatural. </p>
<p> Asked about it, Braffet said she never made the connection. “Carrie” influenced her “only in the same way that every other horrifying high-school story I’d heard was sort of simmering in my subconscious.” To write any kind of page-turner is to run up against the likelihood of overlap with King’s work: there are only so many dramatic scenarios to which he has not turned his imagination over the course of 40 years. </p>
<p> It was important to Braffet, until now, that she publish without her in-laws’ having so much as read her work, so that she had plausible deniability should people hint that Stephen played a hand in publication. With “Save Yourself,” she finally turned to the Kings for advice, when she worried that she had lost her way. “I had no choice,” she said. “I’d already imposed on all my other readers.” Tabitha provided structural advice; Stephen, some notes on language. Mostly they told her to keep going. And no, she maintained, she was not particularly nervous. “It was more important to me that Owen like my work,” she said. </p>
<p> JOE </p>
<p> For the most part, Joe and Owen King got along well: two brothers, five years apart, who entertained themselves with “Star Wars” action figures and role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons and the more obscure Call of Cthulhu. But Joe had one habit that got under Owen’s skin. “I can remember being 8, and eventually everything had to stop so he could write for two hours,” Owen recalls. It did not matter if Owen was perched on the edge of slaying some imaginary monster, his brother was off: “Gotta get my two hours in.” </p>
<p> Joe was 11, a kid in love with his Sherlock Holmes-style deer-stalking cap, when he first started writing daily. Following his father’s equally compulsive example, he made no exception for weekends or holidays. By high school, Joe was serious enough about his literary ambitions that he was already worrying about getting out from under his father’s shadow. He came up with the pen name Jay Stevenson (a pun on “J., Stephen’s son”) and started asking his parents: What would it take to change my name legally? </p>
<p> He attended Vassar College, then moved to New Hampshire and started writing full time, under the pseudonym Joe Hill. “I was very insecure, and I didn’t want to sell something because someone saw it as a way to make a quick buck and then have it come out and someone would say it was terrible,” Hill says. He signed with a New York agent, from whom he concealed his actual identity for eight years. (Over that time, they never met in person.) If he gave a reading and a blogger noted that he bore an uncanny resemblance to a young Stephen King, Hill privately requested that the blogger remove the reference. He spent several years on a novel, which was universally rejected. Years passed. A second novel went nowhere. His parents financially supported him, his wife and his first two children, never once suggesting that he might want to re-examine his options. (He and his wife are divorced.) </p>
<p> And then finally, in 2007, at 35, Hill published “Heart-Shaped Box,” a ghost story with an aging rock star as its hero, a novel less schematic than many of his father’s books, more dreamy. Firmly grounded in celebrity culture, unpredictable both in form and plot, the book was almost immediately a best seller. </p>
<p> At times in his life, Hill actually contemplated hiring an actor to do readings of his work, to conceal that unmistakable resemblance to his father. By the time “Heart-Shaped Box” was published and he had forged ahead with some readings, his alias had been blown. In the end, in light of the book’s success, that did not seem to matter; now he’s comfortable writing in a genre his father dominates. “Sometimes I think the kid who’s like, ‘I’m never going to be like my dad in any way whatsoever,’ is less his own person,” he said. </p>
<p> His acclaim brought different stresses. “I think the pressure of that success resulted in some anxieties picking up,” Hill said. At its worst, about five years ago, while he was writing his second novel, “Horns,” Hill’s anxiety crossed into something more like classic paranoia. “I would do stuff like get to a hotel room and tear the room apart looking for fiber-optic video cameras — I once took my car apart.” He developed other compulsions: he could not stop working if a sentence ended on an odd count of letters; he missed appointments because he made so many trips back home to make sure he had turned off the oven. </p>
<p> Hill suspects that those tendencies are another inheritance from his father, along with the compulsion to write and a fascination with the macabre. Stephen King is uneasy about the number 13, which is not something he puts on simply to charm the press (asked to donate $13,000 to bring home some Maine troops for the holidays in 2009, he donated, instead, $12,999). He is compulsive about certain kinds of counting. He has concocted a mind-numbing game that involves continually resetting his car’s odometer while crossing out numbers in a notebook. And “ravens freak him out, crows freak him out a little bit,” Joe says. “They’re harbingers of death. My mom is more like the family reality check — I learned the oven stuff from him.” </p>
<p> Hill’s most recent book, “NOS4A2” (pronounced Nosferatu), features an immortal villain who whisks children off to a hellishly jolly Christmasland. The book is filled with details so troubling they border on nauseating: implied sexual violence, a mentally impaired reprobate, desperate messengers of doom. To marvel at how deftly he disturbs is to wonder how talent — and this particular talent — passes from father to son. </p>
<p> King and Hill have a way of turning questions about the roots of their dark imaginations into opportunities to sound more wholesome and sane than the person posing the query. In a recent interview with Terry Gross, King joked about how journalists inevitably try to turn into “Dr. Freud and put me on the couch,” then confessed to a happy childhood. Hill, too, seemed, at first, to think the investigation is pointless. “I wonder why no one looks at an engineer and thinks, What was it in his childhood that made him want to be an engineer?” But Hill eventually conceded that something about his particular mental makeup did lend itself well to his subject matter — and it seemed he had thought about that subject quite a lot. “I’ve had a lot of practice spinning paranoid scenarios in fiction — which means I’m good at spinning paranoid scenarios in my own life,” he told me. “It’s a chicken-or-egg situation: Which came first? Is fiction and creating scenarios a way of getting rid of that anxiety? Or is it the practice of writing that has made me more vulnerable to the panic attack?” </p>
<p> A low dose of Paxil has kept Hill’s paranoia in check, as he wrote on a post on his Tumblr account, which he titled “Took Off My Crazypants.” His writing is not suffering, and he is enjoying success. And unlike his father, he said, “now I don’t really care about the number 13.” </p>
<p> TABBY </p>
<p> In 2003, Stephen King won the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and was invited to give a speech at the National Book Awards. King spent close to the first half of the lengthy speech celebrating his wife for always believing in him, for encouraging him to write, even when they were scraping by in a trailer home with two kids and she was working at Dunkin’ Donuts and he did shifts at a laundry. You could develop the impression that Tabitha — Tabby, as she’s known — was the stand-by-your-man type, a wife who would graciously defer to the dreams of her husband at the expense of her own comfort. That may all be true. But after seeing her with her family, I came away with the strong sense that if she encouraged King to keep going, it was because she was no fool — she had editorial judgment and knew good writing when she saw it. They were both students at the University of Maine in 1969 when King handed her a short story to read. “I remember thinking,” she recalled, “This guy’s publishable right this second.” </p>
<p> One of Tabby’s favorite T-shirts reads, “If I’m speaking, you should be taking notes,” and frequently, her family members do. “When I wrote ‘NOS4A2,’ I wrote a really bleak ending, and I was artistically committed to it, come hell or high water — right up until Mum read it,” Joe said, sitting at the table with his family. “She said, ‘You know, Joe, that ending really won’t do.’ I was like, ‘Aww, all right.’ My artistic integrity lasted about 15 seconds on the phone with my mum.” </p>
<p> The feedback goes both ways. “And when you wrote ‘Survivor,’ Tabby, we all ganged up on you about the ending in that book,” Stephen recalled. </p>
<p> “Yeah, and the changes made it a best seller,” Tabby joked, then blew a loud raspberry. The book came and went, although Library Journal called it a “compelling psychological drama,” a book that “belongs in most fiction collections.” Tabby, who is slowly working on her ninth book, clearly feels ill served by the publishing industry, so much so that she encouraged Joe to use a pseudonym. “The perception that Steve’s success got me published cannot be erased for some people,” she said. The assumption, natural though it may be, is misguided: a trilogy of novels she wrote set in Maine — “Pearl,” “The Book of Reuben” and “One on One” — is pure narrative pleasure (the author Jennifer Weiner said “Pearl” was one of her all-time favorite reads). It may have been her husband’s shadow that held her back, or it may have been the same problems that hold back many midlist writers — work that falls between literary and comedy, novels with no gimmicks or glamorous locations. That her books aren’t better known pains her sons, both of whom consider her influence on their work as strong as that of their father’s. “At least, I hope that’s true,” Owen says. “Her sense of place, her sense of character — it’s just so strong.” </p>
<p> If Tabby does occupy something of a saintly status in the King household, it is not just because she stood by her husband when he was young and desperate, but because she threatened to walk away, years later, when he was famous and a full-blown alcoholic with a coke habit. In 1987, Tabby staged an intervention that all three children — Naomi, then 17, Joe, 15, and Owen, 10 — attended. All Owen knew until that point was that his father “consumed massive amounts of alcohol — but I might as well have assumed that everybody’s dad did that.” Tabby explained to all of them that if their father did not agree to get sober, she would ask him to leave. “I didn’t want to lie to my kids,” she said. “I’ve never really gotten lying anyway, because all you do is postpone the day at which you’re revealed to be a liar.” As the family discussed the intervention all these years later, the conversation grew almost hushed. “It was terrifying,” Naomi said. “Are you going to have a dad anymore?” </p>
<p> It took about two years, but King finally did get sober. Then there was a period of calm, until 1999, when King ran up against a series of near-tragic events. While walking down a country road near his home, he was hit by a van that tossed him 14 feet and reduced the bones in his lower left leg “to so many marbles in a sack,” in the words of one doctor. In chronic pain for months of recovery, he developed (and eventually kicked) an addiction to the painkillers. And finally, he came down with pneumonia, checking into the hospital within 24 hours of the speech he gave toasting his wife at the National Book Awards. “The pulmonologist wasn’t sure he’d get through the night, but that’s just what he did,” Tabby said. “I’ve told him, I’m not doing that again. It was just too hard.” </p>
<p> There was a moment during the interview when one of the King children was talking about a book, and Stephen turned toward his wife and took her hand. He grasped it, tightly, and they both closed their eyes and leaned in toward each other, as if in prayer. Later, when asked about that moment, Stephen could not remember what inspired that moment — maybe nothing at all. “Sometimes I just take her hand,” he said. “We’ve always been close, Tab and me. I love her.” </p>
<p> NAOMI </p>
<p> It is an odd twist of fate that Stephen King’s first child, Naomi, was born with a chronic deficit of the hormone adrenaline. She grew, over time, to be an avid reader, but the power of her father’s books was lost on her, as terror, she believes, is a hard emotion for her to access. So her father asked her, when she was a teenager, what it was that she did like. She told him she liked dragons, and her father wrote her a book, “The Eyes of the Dragon,” a fantasy tale complete with an evil, conniving magician in the king’s palace. He dedicated the book to her. </p>
<p> As a young girl, long before she met the Kings, Braffet used to stare at that dedication. “And I remember thinking to myself, Wow, Naomi King’s life must be awesome,” Braffet recalled at the Kings’ kitchen table. Naomi responded, with the same light sarcastic tone her mother employs to great effect, “Every minute.” </p>
<p> The advantages of being a King are, of course, considerable, and the family is close; but there were also the difficult years of Stephen’s addiction, years Naomi was old enough to recognize as painful. And then there are the assumptions people have about her as the offspring of Stephen King. “There’s the expectation that I love horror as a genre or that I care about monsters,” she said. “And I do care about monsters — I care very much about theological interpretations of how we make friends with our monsters. If we demonize other people and create monsters out of each other and act monstrous — and we all have that capacity — then how do we not become monsters ourselves?” </p>
<p> Naomi sounds, maybe, like what Stephen might sound like if, in some alternate universe, he entered divinity school to become a minister, as Naomi did in 1999. It was uncharted territory in the King household. “I truly can’t imagine a more secular family than ours,” Owen said. But Naomi maintains that religion was always there: Tabitha’s family was Catholic, and Stephen, who grew up with devoutly Christian family members, used to win prizes at Sunday school for reciting Bible verses. “I’m not sure you can grow up with those stories without them influencing you and making their way into your everyday speech,” Naomi says. And then, of course, the presence of A.A. in their home was its own kind of influence, if not a religious one, then a spiritual one. </p>
<p> If Naomi is at peace with her choice, the family still seems to be mulling why she did not pursue fiction. “I think possibly Naomi has been more intimidated by the production of fiction than you guys were,” Tabitha said, meaning Joe and Owen. “She made a deliberate choice to find her own area.” </p>
<p> Stephen added: “But you know you were always good — she was always good. She wrote fantasy when she was a kid and into her teenage years, and it was all terrific stuff. It just needed some seasoning.” </p>
<p> Naomi sighed — the encouragement was well intentioned but misplaced. “I have different stories, and those are the ones I tell. It’s just a different genre.” There are the stories she communicates to readers through her online ministry. There are also the stories she creates through sock monkeys costumed as adventuring pirates, whose exploits she creates and then documents on her Flickr account. “It’s about play, and it’s totally congruent with who I am as a religious leader,” she said, “but that isn’t what people have been taught to think.” Like every other member of her family, she has stories in her life, and they sustain her. </p>
<p> Although she writes daily prayers that she posts on Facebook and her blog, Naomi’s ongoing health problems have made a full-time ministry impossible. She now works at the Pietree Orchard, a shop and property near her parents that they purchased in 2007, rather than see it converted to condominiums. </p>
<p> She likes her work, and although she also reads widely, she has never secretly hoped that a 600-page zombie novel will spring from her mind. There is an old Hasidic tale Naomi likes to share, about an aged scholar named Zusya. One after the next, his students approach him, concerned that they might not be measuring up to greatness. Why, one asks him, am I not more like Jacob? Why, asks another, am I not more like Moses? </p>
<p> Naomi smiled as she narrated the ending: “When I die, I’m not going to be asked why I wasn’t like Moses,” Zusya tells them. “I’m going to be asked why I wasn’t like Zusya.” </p>
<p> It was a good story. She told it well. </p>
<p> OWEN </p>
<p> Owen’s first novel, “Double Feature,” opens with a young man awakening abruptly from a dream: “A shadow grew, grew and grew, its mountainous shoulders overwhelming the bright frame.” The young hero panics. His pulse “was in his fingers and his toes, behind his eyes, under his tongue. He was afraid.” Then the shadow speaks: it is the son’s father; he has read the son’s screenplay; he wants to share some notes. </p>
<p> That one page — with its slapstick nod to the anxiety of influence, to the literary shadow that might well be on readers’ minds — is as close to writing actual horror as Owen King ever gets. He is not drawn to the genre; by the time he was 10, he had been exposed, he felt, through his father’s films, to enough maggot-infested corpses and severed heads to leave him “a little bit squeamish.” “Double Feature” feels more Nick Hornby than Stephen King, tracing the story of an ambitious indie filmmaker — the son of a well-known B-movie actor — whose pet project becomes a cult classic for all the worst reasons. </p>
<p> Owen insists that any resemblances in the book to anyone living or dead is purely coincidental, unless that person is Orson Welles. But the emotional architecture seems clearly modeled on something familiar from his own home. “I think the particulars are completely different,” says his friend Tom Bissell, a cultural critic, “but it is about influence and feeling somehow trapped by that influence. And I think in some wonderful ways the book is an escape act — he did it.” </p>
<p> Tabby has sympathy for her children’s desires to stake out their own territory but also feels that their burdens are hardly unusual. “Everybody’s got parents, and they carry something from that,” she told me. “Sometimes it’s the children of a doctor dealing with: Is dad ever home or is he too demanding? Or else you’re the child of the town drunk or the town minister. You’re the child of somebody who has cast some sort of a shadow over your life, from whom you have to differentiate yourself.” </p>
<p> Owen spent years watching B-movies as research for the book and is known among his friends for being the kind of person who will forever be capable of naming them all, while cross-referencing their third-string stars with those actors’ other, even more obscure works. His brother and father also share that skill. “The King men seem able not only to read and write and allude faster than the rest of us — they seem to watch TV faster, listen to music faster, to defy the physics of consumption,” says Joshua Ferris, a novelist and close friend of Owen’s. Of the two brothers, Joe is the more enthusiastic fanboy — picture him unironically wearing his favorite “Jaws” T-shirt, because “Jaws” is one of his four favorite movies. Owen’s favorite T-shirt ever, by contrast, was for a defunct girls’ magazine and read, “Jane: Everything Great About Being a Girl.” He wore it to meet Kelly’s parents for the first time. </p>
<p> Like Joe, Owen, as a young boy, often sat down with his father to talk about books — in his case, to deconstruct what made a Flannery O’Connor story work or to find the ways he could make his own writing more vivid. He enjoyed these sessions, but not because he already had some idea that he wanted to be a writer. “It was something I’d seen my dad do with my brother, and I sort of wanted to feel included,” he told me. As much because of temperament as subject matter, Owen’s current relationship with his father is less intensively collaborative than that of Joe, who gets feedback on all his drafts from both parents and frequently calls to talk shop. “I have a much more typical relationship with my parents,” Owen said. “I’m looking for unconditional love from my parents. I’m not particularly interested in getting heavy literary criticism from them.” </p>
<p> On one public occasion, he got it anyway. His father, in an interview with this magazine in 2000, casually characterized Owen’s early work as “flavor-of-the-month, New York relationships.” Owen was angry at the time, but he is easy on his father now, even protective. “Yeah, that wasn’t the greatest,” he said. “My dad felt really bad. But that was a long time ago, and what I do has become easier for my parents to understand.” His father apologized, and Owen, who was getting his M.F.A. at Columbia, kept writing. While he was there, on two occasions, professors at Columbia extravagantly dismissed his father’s body of work while Owen was in the room. He learned that if he was going to write, he would have to be fairly confident that he could find his own voice, regardless of who was talking to him about what fiction should be. When Owen’s novel came out, Stephen turned his Web site into an enthusiastic ad: If you are in the mood to laugh your posterior off, he said in his own vernacular, “ ‘Double Feature’ will perform that surgery and painlessly.” </p>
<p> Owen can live with selling fewer books than his brother or father, both of whom set unusually high standards for that metric. “I think my brother’s and father’s drive for success is greater than mine,” he said. “I just want to sell enough books to be able to justify continuing to write.” As the youngest of the siblings and the one who stayed home, rather than go to boarding school, he was exposed more often than they were to his father’s growing fame — the snapping cameras everywhere, the strangers forever approaching them. “I want to be as successful as I can be while still living a very private life,” he said, “and I think my ambition is probably a little bit limited by that desire.” </p>
<p> His brother, by contrast, embraces the public’s attention. He recently posed for a series of photos in which he pantomimed being strangled and stabbed by fans, then posted them on Twitter. Owen admired the project but could not relate to the impulse. “I don’t want to be choked by a stranger,” he said. “Not even pretend choked.” </p>
<p> STEPHEN </p>
<p> On the Fourth of July, the extended King family gathered at the Pietree Orchard and ate pizza on the picnic benches outside the shop. Some of the grandchildren had gone strawberry picking; later there would be fireworks. Stephen King, sitting on a picnic bench, turned to his 10-year-old grandson. “So if I had a stroke,” King asked him, “what do you think I should do? Should I go into a nursing home? Would that be the best thing?” </p>
<p> The questions were both matter of fact and macabre — a late-in-life version of what the family called the writing game, in which they would each take five minutes to rescue some hero from peril, only to place him once again in danger before passing the challenge on to the next family member. This is the kind of plot twist that most haunts King now: illness, dementia, the loss of his uncommonly active mind. </p>
<p> A few minutes later, he was eager to share an image he had on his iPad. He whisked past pictures — his grandchildren, trees, whoops, there goes Meg Ryan — and then there was a black-and-white photo: a smiling woman sitting on the knee of a merchant mariner. “Those were my parents,” he said. His father abandoned the family when King, the younger of two children, was 2, but when King was about 10, he stumbled upon his father’s stash of old pulp novels. It was Stephen’s first introduction to horror — among the finds there was “Lovecraft,” with a cover of a monster crawling out of a grave. Either because he is his father’s son or because he was a son seeking out his father — King believes it’s the first of those options — he was immediately obsessed, reading every book in the collection and seeking out more wherever and whenever he could. His father, his mother told him, wrote stories, good ones, too, and although he did not stick with it, some magazine editors had encouraged him. The subtext of King’s personal narrative would seem to be that of a child trying to please an absent father, as loudly and successfully as he can. King, however, sees it as a matter of simple genetics. So the fact that his sons, in turn, would be writers, that one of them might even write horror, is therefore wholly predictable to King. “I do think it’s built in,” he said. “You know, sometimes people say to me, ‘Why do you choose to write that creepy stuff?’ And I usually say, ‘What makes you think I have a choice?’ ” </p>
<p> At the guesthouse, after the group portrait was finally taken, the family started to disperse. “Did you really think that the Neil Gaiman book was — what did you call it? Something like ‘an incomparable masterpiece?’ ” Owen asked Joe, referring to a recent blog post about Gaiman’s new novel. “You like everything on Twitter — you can’t like that much stuff.” </p>
<p> Joe shrugged. “I’m a positive guy” he responded, “not a negative guy.” </p>
<p> He had proposed earlier that they gather that evening to play an old game called Ex Libris. The game, a bit like Balderdash, would have them all competing to write the most convincing first line of a randomly chosen actual novel. Somebody wondered: How old was this game? </p>
<p> “It’s as old as storytelling,” Stephen intoned. </p>
<p> “Yeah, the very first Irish balladeers were playing this game,” Owen said. That got a laugh from his dad, so he kept going. “The Gilgamesh guy was playing this game.” </p>
<p> Joe, who had been strenuously trying to turn the conversation back to the rules of Ex Libris, joined in. “They were playing at the Alexandria library,” he said. “As it burned.” </p>
<p> It went on like this for a few minutes. Naomi made a reference to an obscure ancient manuscript depicting beer, Owen cracked a joke about pulps in Mesopotamia. </p>
<p> “In the Old West — ” Joe started. </p>
<p> His father suggested, not unkindly, that they wrap up the conversation. Maybe they would play the game some other time. After lunch, Owen and Kelly wandered down toward the lake with Joshua Ferris and his wife, who were visiting. Stephen and Tabby went back to their primary summer home. And Joe headed inside with the book he had been carrying around all day, a galley his dad gave him of another author’s horror book. </p>
<p> A few days later, Joe and Stephen were having another typical conversation: hashing out what novel could be considered the “Moby-Dick” of horror. </p>
<p> That one with all the footnotes, they argued — no, not that one, the other one: Mark Danielewski’s “House of Leaves.” </p>
<p> Joe bragged that his youngest son, who is 10, was doing some writing of his own. “He’s working on two stories: one is called ‘Scrap’; the other is called ‘The Bad Thing.’ ” </p>
<p> Stephen brightened: he liked that, “The Bad Thing.” “I’m sorry,” he said, as if he had just found someone else’s shiny penny, “I might have to use that.” </p>
<p> Joe understood. “I know,” he said. “I had the same thought myself.” </p>

<p> Stephen King: on alcoholism and returning to the Shining </p>
<p> More than 30 years after Stephen King first terrified readers with The Shining, he's written a sequel, drawing on his alcoholism and a near-death experience. He talks about being a drunk father and why the Twilight series is just 'tweenager porn' </p>
<p> Stephen King has written a lot of books – at 56 novels, he's closing in on Agatha Christie – some of which have been great, some of which less so. Still, he says, when people say, "Steve, your books are uneven", he's confident "there's good stuff in all of 'em". Now and then, a story lingers in his mind long after it's published. When fans ask what happened to Charlie McGee in Firestarter, for example, King isn't interested. But when they ask what happened to Danny Torrance, the boy from The Shining, he always found himself wondering. Specifically: what the story would have looked like if Danny's father – mad "white-knuckle alcoholic" Jack Torrance – had "found AA. And I thought, well, let's find out." </p>
<p> At 65, King is a big, shaggy presence, towering despite his slightly stooped shoulders and with an air of affable amusement at the vastness of his success and all that comes with it. We are at a house in Maine that his assistant, opening the door, drily refers to as "spare"; it's one of several King properties in the area, on a lake, and designated vaguely as a summer house. It is at the end of a long, deserted road, surrounded by woodland and in a GPS dead zone; this, after a week of rereading King novels, is unrelaxing. Rather than spend the night in a remote B&B near his house, as his publisher suggests, I stay in Portland, 100 miles away, in a hotel where there are lights and cars going by, and people to hear you scream. "Really?" King says when I mention my unease, and grins. "Good." </p>
<p> Doctor Sleep, his 56th novel, revisits Danny in adulthood, when he has become an alcoholic drifter haunted by the memory of his raging father. The Shining had such resonance – in part because of Kubrick's film, which King disliked – that one returns to the characters with a sense of deep familiarity. In the sequel, Wendy, the mother, is dead from lung cancer and Danny is alone, working in a hospice in a small town, where his paranormal talents help people towards a peaceful death. When Abra, a telepathic child, pushes into his consciousness asking for help, Danny gets sucked back into the terrain of his childhood, battling a bunch of centuries-old serial killers disguised as RV-driving pensioners (it is sometimes easy to overlook how slyly funny King is) who literally feed off the pain of others. "When the disaster was big enough," King writes, "agony and violent death had an enriching quality." They get a big kick out of 9/11. </p>
<p> It is scary, of course: a woman with a tusk instead of teeth pops up periodically to hang at second-floor window level and startle the bejesus out of you. And without labouring the point, it has good allegorical bones: the sick buzz one gets from consuming the grisliest news stories. It also captures the reality of a recovering alcoholic, a state with which King is intimately familiar. "The hungover eye," he writes, "had a weird ability to find the ugliest things in any given landscape." Danny turns his life around and starts going to AA meetings, where, King writes, he discovers that memories are the "real ghosts". It is a book as extravagantly inventive as any in King's pantheon, and a careful study of self-haunting: "You take yourself with you, wherever you go." </p>
<p> King has been sober for decades, ever since his family staged an intervention in the late 1980s. If he hesitated to write in this much depth about AA, it was only because he wanted to get it right. "The only thing is to write the truth. To write what you know about any particular situation. And I never say to anybody, 'This is all from my experience in AA,' because you don't say that." It was King's 36-year-old son, Owen, who, after reading the first draft of Doctor Sleep, told him there was something missing. "He said that the scene he remembered best from The Shining was the one where Jack Torrance and his friend are out drunk one night and they hit a bicycle and think they've killed a kid. And they say, 'That's the end; we're not going to drink any more.' And Owen said, 'There's no scene that's comparable to that in Doctor Sleep. You ought to see Dan at his worst.' And, as usual, Owen was right." </p>
<p> The scene King put in, would, in subsequent drafts, go on to drive the whole story: Danny waking up next to a one-night stand, stealing her money and leaving her infant son wandering about with a full nappy, reaching for drugs on the coffee table. "And I think every alcoholic has a story comparable to that. Something where you actually hit rock bottom." </p>
<p> In his case? </p>
<p> "I don't have anything as dramatic. Of course, in a novel, you're looking for something that's really harsh. Harshly lit. For me, when I look back, the thing that I remember is being at one of my son's Little League games with a can of beer in a paper bag, and the coach coming over to me and saying, 'If that's an alcoholic beverage, you're going to have to leave.' That was where I said to myself, 'That's something I'll never be able to tell anybody else. I'll keep that one to myself.' I drew on that memory." </p>
<p> In Doctor Sleep, Danny fights his past with a more profound sense of terror than anything the woman with the tusk can bring on. The tentacle reach of history has always interested King – "What's inside your head grows. And you don't have any sense of proportion until you see how other people react to it" – as has the futility of trying to escape it. "Take Dan Torrance, who is the child of an alcoholic, child of a dysfunctional family, abusive father, and he says, as people do, 'I'm never going to be like my father; I'm never going to be like my mother.' And then you grow up and find yourself with a beer in one hand and a cigarette in the other, and maybe you're walking the kiddies around. And I wanted to see what would happen with that." </p>
<p> For a while, King would write sober during the day and edit what he had set down, while drinking, at night. "As time went on, I started to fumble a lot of the balls. I had a busy public life and a lot of those things got a bit ragged by the end." Did he, like Danny, go to bars and get in fights? </p>
<p> "No. I didn't go out and drink in bars, because they were full of assholes like me." </p>
<p> Stephen King has been at the top of his game for a very long time, but his quirks still give him a quiver of outsidership. Before he became fashionable, he was deeply unfashionable – a nerdy guy writing in a nerdy genre, married with three kids when everyone else in his generation was raging through the 1960s. For a while, he and his wife, Tabitha, lived in a trailer in Herman, Maine (as King once put it, "If not the asshole of the universe, then at least within farting distance of it"). In literary circles, it is a more outlandish background than the most lurid of King's horror stories: Tabitha worked in a Dunkin' Donuts and King supplemented his high school teaching income at a laundry and a filling station. He felt under such tremendous pressure during those years, he says, that it was as if "battery cables were hooked up to your head. Like your brain was a battery." </p>
<p> He was a good teacher – the kids enjoyed his classes – but he felt trapped in the wrong life. "I would teach, and I would come home tired, like I'd been on stage. And then I had to correct papers – more of the same. And there was very little time left for my own work. I can remember thinking, 'Two or three more years of this and I won't be able to write at all.' Because they wanted to give me the debating club, and the play, and stuff like that. There was no discussion of me quitting. We would have had nothing to live on. We were barely making ends meet, living in crappy apartments." </p>
<p> His wife encouraged him to keep at it, and in those early days, King says, he was highly motivated by "this gush of image and story and words. It was like somebody yelled, 'Fire!' in a crowded theatre and everybody's trying to crowd through the door at the same time – that was ideas and work." By their mid-20s, they had two children and were very stretched. </p>
<p> Most of his friends weren't even married. Why have kids so young? </p>
<p> He bursts out laughing. "Because they came! Naomi was about nine months old when we got married. Tabby was 21. And then it seemed like a great idea to give Naomi a brother or sister. I can remember being home one day and there was a knock at the door – a guy selling something – and he said, 'Hon, is your mommy home?' And Tab said, 'I'm the mommy.' We had two kids by then." </p>
<p> Every scrap of free time had to be put to good use. During one particularly frenzied period, King bashed out The Running Man in a week. A week! "February vacation week. I was white hot, I was burning. That was quite a week, because Tabby was trying to get back and forth to Dunkin' Donuts and I had the kids. I wrote when they napped or I would stick them in front of the TV. Joe was in a playpen. It seemed like it snowed the whole week, and I wrote the book. Couldn't sell it." </p>
<p> In King's 1986 novel It, the character Stuttering Bill stands in for the author as a highly successful horror writer, who corrects journalists when they ask where he gets his ideas from. The better question, Bill says, is why do they come in that particular form? Why horror? King has always recoiled from glib readings of a childhood rift in his psyche: a father who left when King was an infant, never to return. But it was through his father that he discovered writing: a book he found in the attic, which his father left behind. It was a collection of short stories by HP Lovecraft called The Lurker In The Shadows and had a demon on the cover. King read it as a boy and something pinged in his brain. </p>
<p> Everything changed with Carrie, the story of a telekinetic teenager and her sublime rage at her fundamentalist mother and bullying schoolmates. It was picked up in 1973 by Doubleday, for an advance of $2,500. That was enough for the Kings to buy a new car. A year later, when the paperback rights went out for auction, King expected to make something in the region of $60,000, half of which would go to his publisher. Since $30,000 was more than he earned in a year as a teacher, he planned to take a sabbatical and write two more books. "But the advance turned out to be $500,000." </p>
<p> King notes with some amusement that he has been around so long that kids who read and loved him in the 1970s now run publishing houses and newspapers; he is revered, these days, as a grand old man of American letters. The experience of reading King young – "Under the covers with a flashlight at summer camp," as he puts it – doesn't leave one, and although he says, casually, that "it's pretty easy to scare a 14-year-old", the pleasures of his books endure. There is a lightfootedness to King's prose, a quickness of thought and expression that over the course of decades has somehow always seemed modern. It's partly a function of speed: his books err on the long side – a casualty of quick turnaround – but the action rattles along at a pace that is mimicked in the snap and verve of his language. In Dr Sleep, the serial killers appear with "faces like old apples and the moon shone right through". Danny, in the hospice, observes of a dead patient, "inside was all the clockless silence of death". It's what King does best, matching dim fears with indelible images, and it is recognised these days as a rare talent. </p>
<p> For a long time this wasn't the case. Condescension and a certain amount of hostility used to mark the critical reaction, and because of that, perhaps, he is belligerently against what he sees as rarefied writing types. Stuttering Bill Denbrough in It storms out of a college writing class when the instructor sneers at his horror story. "Why does a story have to be socio-anything?" Bill asks. "Politics… culture… history… aren't those natural ingredients in any story, if it's told well? I mean… can't you guys just let a story be a story?" </p>
<p> The biggest beef King has with mainstream literary culture is one of productivity. He was recently asked by the New York Times to review Donna Tartt's new novel, The Goldfinch. "And Donna Tartt is an amazingly good writer. She's dense, she's allusive. She's a gorgeous storyteller. But three books in 30 years? That makes me want to go to that person and grab her by the shoulders and look into her face and say, 'Do you realise how little time you have in the scheme of things?' " </p>
<p> It is 11 years since Tartt's last book, and King says, "I looked at it and thought, 'God help you, Donna, this better be interesting.' " And was it? He smiles. "It's very good." When people ask why he is so prolific, he smiles and tells them: "I'll stop soon enough." </p>
<p> Almost all his books have been turned into movies, the bulk of which have been successful, although King doesn't bite his tongue when something isn't to his liking. He enjoyed Brian De Palma's 1976 adaptation of Carrie, starring Sissy Spacek. But he "hated" what Stanley Kubrick did to The Shining in 1980: the film turned his novel into "a domestic tragedy with only vaguely supernatural overtones", he said at the time. He also thought Jack Nicholson hammed it up appallingly, and Shelley Duvall as Wendy was "insulting to women. She's basically a scream machine." </p>
<p> It has been frustrating, he says, when he has tried to bust out of his genre and been largely dismissed or misunderstood – primarily with his novel Needful Things, a satire of Reagan-era materialism that baffled the critics. "They read it and said, 'This is just peculiar.' " He has a lot of sympathy for JK Rowling, who was spectacularly mauled for her first non-Harry Potter novel, The Casual Vacancy, which King is reading at the moment. </p>
<p> "Man, this book is like… Do you remember Tom Sharpe? It's a bit like that. And it's a bit like Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf? It's fucking nasty. And I love it. The centre of the book is a dinner party from hell and you say to yourself, 'These little people in the town of Pagford are a microcosm not just of British society, but western society as a whole, of a certain class.' The fact that she set it around this little election that nobody cares about in a shit little town is fabulous. She's a wonderful storyteller and the writing is better than in any of the Harry Potter books, because it's sharper." </p>
<p> King is not so successful as to be above the fray, and he is sceptical about some of his more direct rivals in the mega-selling horror and fantasy categories. Contrary to popular opinion, he says, this is not a golden age of horror. What about the Twilight franchise? "I agree with Abra's teacher friend [in Doctor Sleep] who calls Twilight and books like it tweenager porn. They're really not about vampires and werewolves. They're about how the love of a girl can turn a bad boy good." </p>
<p> Sweet Valley High with teeth? </p>
<p> "Yeah. Pretend I said that." </p>
<p> Does he read them out of professional interest? </p>
<p> "I read Twilight and didn't feel any urge to go on with her. I read The Hunger Games and didn't feel an urge to go on. It's not unlike The Running Man, which is about a game where people are actually killed and people are watching: a satire on reality TV. I read Fifty Shades Of Grey and felt no urge to go on. They call it mommy porn, but it's not really mommy porn. It is highly charged, sexually driven fiction for women who are, say, between 18 and 25. But a golden age of horror? I wouldn't say it is. I can't think of any books right now that would be comparable to The Exorcist." </p>
<p> When his children were little, King didn't stop them from reading his own books, or watching the film versions. (In fact, when his oldest son Joe was 12, he overheard him explaining to a friend that his seven-year-old brother Owen was allowed to read and watch these things. "Joe said very seriously, 'You have to understand, my father writes scary stories. Owen has lived with horror his whole life.' " King laughs uproariously.) </p>
<p> In 1982, during an air traffic control strike, King was making a film called Creepshow and, unable to fly, drove 600 miles every week back and forth to Pittsburgh from Maine. To pass the time, he asked his daughter Naomi to record audio books for him of titles that didn't exist in that format - Wilbur Smith novels, for example; he would pay her $5 per cassette. "She was all over that like white on rice. She did it and then Joe got on board, and finally Owen, too." </p>
<p> They are a close family. Both boys are now writers and Naomi, who also writes, is a Unitarian minister. They have come a long way since the bad old days when Tabitha threatened to leave him if he didn't stop boozing and taking cocaine. Owen, his youngest, was 10 then and Naomi 17. It is better to be frank about these things, King believes, since people always find out about them anyway. But memories of the intervention are still painful. </p>
<p> "There's a thing in AA, something they read in a lot of meetings, The Promises. Most of those promises have come true in my life: we'll come to know a new freedom and new happiness, that's true. But it also says in there: we will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it. And I have no wish to shut the door on the past. I have been pretty upfront about my past. But do I regret? I do. I do. I regret the necessity." </p>
<p> Still, he feels pretty lucky, not least after a near-death experience in 1999. King was walking down a road near his house when he was hit by a truck and thrown 14ft in the air. There were no white lights, but it did get him thinking seriously about death. "Our body knows things, and our brain knows things that don't have anything to do with conscious thought. And I think that it's possible, when you die, that there is a final exit programme that goes into effect. And that's what people are seeing when they see their relatives or a white light or whatever it is. In that sense, there may really be a heaven if you believe there's a heaven, and a hell if you believe there is one. But there's some kind of transitional moment. That idea that your whole life flashes before your eyes." He smiles. "Of course, they say about co-dependents – people who grow up around alcoholics – that somebody else's life does." </p>
<p> It is this moment of transition that Doctor Sleep deals with and the idea, like so many of King's, came from an incidental story in a newspaper. This one was about "a cat in a hospice that knows when people are going to die. He would go into that patient's room and curl up next to them. And I thought, that's a good advertisement for death, for the emissary of death. I thought, 'I can make Dan the human equivalent of that cat, and call him Doctor Sleep.' There was the book." </p>
<p> When King wakes in the night, he is not preoccupied with thoughts of death. He worries about his grandchildren, or turns over new ideas. His writing habits have changed over the years. "As you get older, you lose some of the velocity off your fast ball. Then you resort more to craft: to the curve, to the slider, to the change-up. To things other than that raw force." </p>
<p> He is as successful as ever, with a hit TV show, Under The Dome, about a town cut off from the world by the sudden descent of a large, overturned fish bowl, a clever twist on the locked room scenario. He has also just had the earliest peckings of a new book idea. It came from a news story that was big in the US last year, about a Brooklyn woman who drove the wrong way down a motorway with a car full of children, killing them all. It wasn't the horror of the incident that interested King, but the unanswered questions. "I have stories that ask to be written. And the thing that interested me about that crash on I-95 was that her husband swears up and down that she wasn't a big drinker, and that she wasn't drunk when she left with them. But there was a bottle of vodka in the car. She was high as a kite. So I'm saying to myself, there's a real mystery here." A pause. "It's the kind of mystery that only fiction can unravel." And so it begins. </p>

<p> Stephen King's Real Horror Story: How the novelist's addiction to drink and drugs nearly killed him </p>
<p> As the tall, thin man in his mid-40s lay unconscious on the floor of his office, his eyes shut tight and his shirt-front soaked with blood, the silence of the night all around him was broken only by the shrieks of the bats which haunted the rafters of his vast Victorian mansion. </p>
<p> The scene was like something out of a novel by that master of the macabre Stephen King, ironic given that the comatose figure was none other than King himself - dead to the world after drinking countless cans of beer and snorting so much cocaine that his ravaged nose had become a gushing crimson fountain. </p>
<p> Shocking though his condition was, this was no one-off. Writing 63 books over 35 years, with best-selling stories such as Carrie, The Shining, Misery and The Green Mile turned into blockbusting movies, King has long been one of the world's most successful authors, with an estimated fortune of £135million. </p>
<p> Yet, as is revealed in a fascinating new biography, he spent most of the Eighties on an extended drug and alcohol binge which so fogged his mind that even today he cannot remember working on many of the books he wrote during that period. </p>
<p> For King, drink and drugs helped provide an escape from the unhappiness which has dogged him since he was a child, growing up in poverty in Portland, Maine, after the Second World War. </p>

<p> His father Donald, a womanising vacuum cleaner salesman, walked out on the family in 1949 when Stephen was just two. Left to bring up the boy and his older brother David, their mother Ruth took a succession of poorly paid menial jobs, leaving her sons in the care of various relatives. King was convinced she would one day abandon him and his brother, just as their father had. </p>
<p> An insecure child, plagued by nightmares in which his mother was laid out in a coffin and he saw himself hanging from a gallows, with crows pecking out his eyes, his anxieties included everything from a terror of falling down the toilet, to paranoia about death, deformity, and even clowns. </p>
<p> As he grew up, he discovered that he could only deal with these bogeymen by writing stories about them, rattling away so furiously on his second-hand typewriter that the letter M eventually broke off and he had to write in the missing letters by hand. </p>
<p> But as a student of English at the University of Maine, he also found more dangerous ways of escaping from reality. Taking marijuana, speed and LSD, he was arrested a month before his graduation for stealing traffic cones after drinking heavily at a local bar - a warning of the far more worrying behaviour to come. </p>
<p> Jack Nicholson stars in one of Stephen King's best-known works, The Shining </p>
<p> He married fellow student Tabitha Spruce in January 1971. Their daughter Naomi had been born the previous June and when their son Joe arrived in 1972, the couple struggled to survive on King's salary as a high-school teacher. </p>
<p> Forced to work in a laundry during the school holidays to help pay the bills, and receiving a string of rejection letters from publishers, King became increasingly frustrated at his failure as a novelist. When he was drunk, his anger became focused on his children. </p>
<p> 'I wanted to grab them and hit them,' he has admitted. 'Even though I didn't do it, I felt guilty because of my brutal impulses. I wasn't prepared for the realities of fatherhood.' </p>
<p> The death of his mother at the end of 1973 sent him into a depression which did not lift even after the publication of his first success, Carrie, the following year. This one book earned him £100,000 for the paperback rights alone, more money than he'd ever hoped to see in a lifetime. </p>

<p> Still tormented by a desire to hurt his children, he turned to the technique he had learned as a child himself - believing that if he wrote about something bad, then it would never happen. This resulted in The Shining, the story of a little boy whose alcoholic father tries to kill him. </p>
<p> While this may have helped control his hostility towards his family, it did nothing to reduce his drinking. His friends noted he could down six to eight beers in the time it took them to drink two and soon he was even imbibing during book signings. </p>
<p> On one occasion, his wife kicked him out of their home in Bangor, Maine. But even this did not stop his hitting the bottle - for his addiction was driven by an awful fear. Since he had been drinking when he wrote his first best-sellers, he now worried that he might be unable to write without being drunk, unthinkable for a man whose creative outpourings were the only way he could cope with the dark thoughts that plagued him. </p>
<p> These now included phobias of snakes, rats, small spaces, 'squishy' things, flying, and even the number 13 - and the importance of his writing as a means of keeping these at bay became apparent when he had a vasectomy following the birth of his son Owen in 1979. </p>
<p> During the midst of a furious writing session in the days following the operation, he began bleeding from the incision and his wife was horrified to find him sitting at his typewriter in a pool of blood. She tried to get him to stop work, but he brushed her off. 'Anyone else would have been screaming, but he said, "Hold on, let me finish this paragraph!" ' she recalled. </p>
<p> Smoking at least two packets of cigarettes a day, King craved anything which might drive him on in his writing, including the cocaine freely available at the Hollywood parties he attended as Carrie and The Shining were turned into movies towards the end of the Seventies. </p>
<p> Many of King's novels play on fears that most people have - like all-engulfing, dangerous mist </p>
<p> 'One snort and cocaine owned me body and soul,' he said. 'It was my on-switch, and it seemed like a really good energising drug.' </p>
<p> In 1980, the Kings renovated and moved into an imposing 24-room house in Bangor - with bat motifs on the stained-glass windows and a wrought-iron fence paying homage to the real-life creatures which flitted-around the old roof spaces. </p>
<p> This became a place of pilgrimage for King fans, who hung around for hours in hope of a glimpse of their hero, throwing books and presents into the seven-acre garden and occasionally haranguing visitors as they drove through the gates. </p>
<p> They kept vigil unaware that, during his late-night marathon writing sessions, their idol was supplementing the many gallons of beer he drank with so much cocaine that he had to stick cotton wool up his nose to stop blood dripping on to his typewriter. </p>
<p> His dependency had reached such a pitiful stage five years later that he had resorted to buying antiseptic mouthwash for its alcohol content - as his editor Chuck Verrill saw during the making of the film Maximum Overdrive, King's directorial debut. </p>
<p> 'He was gargling Listerine and popping pills,' recalled Verrill. 'He was still a nice guy and coherent, but he did seem to be strung out.' </p>
<p> King later said he was 'coked out of my mind' during the making of the film, but at first his escalating drug problem did not appear to affect his output. His spine-chiller It became America's best-selling book of 1986 and the following year he received critical acclaim for his thriller Misery. </p>
<p> By then, however, he was sober for only three hours a day, and he spent most of that time thinking of blowing his brains out. 'I love my life and my wife and kids, but I've always been somewhat quasi-suicidal, constantly wanting to push things past the edge,' he said. </p>
<p> With his blackouts from cocaine and alcohol becoming more and more frequent, and his book The Tommyknockers receiving a critical savaging in 1988, those around him worried that he was reaching rock bottom. </p>
<p> Still popular: Stephen King has retained his appeal despite the problems he faced in the Eighties </p>
<p> Padding down their magnificent mahogany staircase each morning, Tabitha King had become used to finding her husband passed out in a puddle of vomit next to his desk - and finally she decided that she had endured enough. </p>
<p> Searching through his office one day, she gathered up all the paraphernalia of his substance abuse: the packets of white powder, the cocaine spoons, the empty beer cans, and the bottles of Listerine. </p>
<p> Throwing these into a dustbin, she called together their children and a few friends as witnesses, emptied the contents on to the floor in front of her husband, and warned that she would leave him if he continued on his path towards self-destruction. </p>
<p> King stared at the incriminating pile of evidence gathered in front of him and finally realised that, if he didn't change his ways, it would probably cost him his family - even his life. Even so, it took many false starts and broken promises for him to go clean and, when he finally did, his greatest fear came true: he could no longer write. </p>
<p> Realising that this might easily send him into a relapse, Tabitha King remained at her husband's side throughout many difficult nights and days, helping him to write one word at a time until, little by little, his ability to tell a story returned. </p>
<p> As he emerged from this period of crippling writer's block, his admirers claimed there was a new intelligence and depth to his writing. This seemed confirmed in April 1990, when critics who looked down on his work were outraged by the publication of one of his short stories in the New Yorker, the magazine regarded as the preserve of America's literary elite. </p>
<p> With more thoughtful works such as The Green Mile and Hearts In Atlantis, he has since moved still further from the blood-curdling novels for which he is famous. But devotees of his horror stories should not give up hope. </p>
<p> His writing may no longer be fuelled by his addiction to drugs and alcohol, but King is still driven to tell stories as a way of allaying his many fears. Although he has addressed just about all of those over the years, from clowns in It to crazed fans in Misery, there is one thing he has not yet found the courage to face. </p>
<p> 'To me, spiders are just about the most horrible, awful things that I can think about,' he has confessed. 'But I want to write about them because it's the one theme that scares just about everybody.' </p>
<p> It might take some time for Stephen King to face this final nightmare but, given his past compulsion to write away his terrors, we can be sure that he will one day do so and once again terrify us all. </p>

<p> Stephen King has spent half a century scaring us, but his legacy is so much more than horror </p>
<p> It’s a big year for King adaptations, but the movies only tell part of the story. </p>
<p> Share this story </p>
<p> Share All sharing options for: Stephen King has spent half a century scaring us, but his legacy is so much more than horror </p>
<p> It’s nearly impossible to overstate how influential Stephen King is. For the past four decades, no single writer has dominated the landscape of genre writing like him. To date, he is the only author in history to have had more than 30 books become No. 1 best-sellers. He now has more than 70 published books, many of which have become cultural icons, and his achievements extend so far beyond a single genre at this point that it’s impossible to limit him to one — even though, as the world was reminded last year when the feature film adaptation of It became the highest-grossing horror movie on record, horror is still King’s calling card. </p>
<p> In fact, we’ve been enjoying a cultural resurgence of quality King horror adaptations lately, from small-screen adaptations like Gerald’s Game and Castle Rock to the upcoming remake of Pet Sematary, the first trailer for which looks like a promising continuation of the trend. </p>
<p> That means if you’re a King fan — or looking to become one — there’s no better time to rediscover why he’s such a beloved cultural phenomenon. </p>
<p> After all, without King, we wouldn’t have modern works like Stranger Things, whose adolescent ensemble directly channels the Losers’ Club, King’s ensemble of geeky preteen friends from It. Without The Shining, and Stanley Kubrick’s masterpiece film adaptation, “Here’s Johnny!” would be a dead talk show catchphrase and parodies like the Simpsons’ annual Treehouse of Horror would be bereft of much of their material. </p>
<p> Without Carrie, we wouldn’t have the single defining image of the horror of high school: a vat of pig’s blood being dropped on an unsuspecting prom queen. Without King, we wouldn’t have one of the most iconic and recognizable images in cinema history — Andy Dufresne standing in the rain after escaping from Shawshank prison — nor would we have the enduring horror of Pennywise the Clown, Cujo the slavering St. Bernard, or Kathy Bates’s pitch-perfect stalker fan in Misery. </p>
<p> This is but a sampling born from a staggeringly prolific writing career that’s well on its way to spanning five decades. King has effectively been translating America’s private, communal, and cultural fears and serving them up to us on grisly platters for half a century. </p>
<p> King might have remained a struggling English teacher, but for two women: Tabitha King and Carrie White </p>
<p> Born in 1947, King grew up poor in Durham, Maine, the younger son of a single working mother whose husband, a merchant mariner, abandoned his family when King was still a toddler. A lifelong fan of speculative fiction, King began writing seriously while attending the University of Maine Orono. It was there, in 1969, that he met his wife, Tabitha. </p>
<p> By 1973, King was a high school English teacher drawing a meager $6,400 a year. He had married Tabitha in 1971, and the pair lived in a trailer in Hampden, Maine, and each worked additional jobs to make ends meet. King wrote numerous short stories, some of which were published by Playboy and other men’s magazines, but significant writerly success eluded him. </p>
<p> Tabitha, who’d been one of the first to read Stephen’s short stories in colleges, had loaned Stephen her own typewriter and refused to let him take a higher-paying job that would mean less time to write. Tabitha was also the one who discovered draft pages of what would become Carrie tossed in Stephen’s trash can. She retrieved them and ordered him to keep working on the idea. Ever since, King has continued to pay Tabitha’s encouragement forward. He frequently and effusively blurbs books from established as well as new authors, citing a clear wish to leave publishing better than he found it. Meanwhile, Tabitha is a respected author in her own right, as are both of their sons, Joe Hill and Owen King. </p>
<p> Carrie, which King sold for a $2,500 advance, would go on to earn $400,000 for the rights to its paperback run. The story of a troubled girl who develops powers of telekinesis, Carrie is the ultimate “high school is hell” morality tale. Carrie faces ruthless abuse from her religious mother and bullying from high school classmates, and the book introduces us to two of King’s most prominent themes: small Maine towns with dark underbellies, and main characters written with care and empathy despite being deeply flawed and morally gray — in this case Carrie, her mother, and her bully Sue. The complicated bond between protagonist and antagonist is also a recurring motif in King’s writing. </p>
<p> Two years after Carrie’s publication, Brian De Palma’s 1976 film adaptation grossed $33 million on a $1.8 million budget, largely on the strength of advance critical praise and word-of-mouth reviews. Buoyed by the subsequent success of Carrie’s paperback sales, King would go on to churn out six novels (Salem’s Lot, The Shining, Rage, The Stand, The Long Walk, and The Dead Zone) over the next six years, establishing a prolificacy that would continue through much of his career. </p>
<p> By 1980, King was the world’s best-selling author. </p>
<p> It’s taken decades for King’s work to be critically appreciated — in particular for its literary qualities </p>
<p> King’s work has appeared in magazines ranging from the New Yorker to Harper’s to Playboy. The author has influenced literary writers like Haruki Murakami and Sherman Alexie along with genre creators like the producers of Lost. And he’s won virtually every major horror, mystery, science fiction, and fantasy award there is. But King also spent decades being written off by both the horror writing community and the literary mainstream. </p>
<p> King once referred to critics perceiving him to be “a rich hack,” a perception that bears out in horror writer David Schow’s offhand 1997 description of him as “comparable to McDonald’s” — intended to characterize King as horror’s pedestrian mainstream. When a 1994 King short story, his first to be published in the New Yorker, won the prestigious O. Henry Award, Publishers Weekly declared it to be “one of the weaker stories in this year’s [O. Henry Award] collection.” </p>
<p> “The price he pays for being Stephen King is not being taken seriously,” one of King’s collaborators told the LA Times in 1995. </p>
<p> The critical disparagement of King often went hand in hand with genre shaming. In a 1997 60 Minutes interview, Lesley Stahl questioned King’s literary tastes, getting him to admit that he’d never read Jane Austen and had only read one Tolstoy novel. In response, King grinned that he had, instead, read every novel Dean Koontz had ever written — Dean Koontz being a notoriously lowbrow writer of thrillers. (That same year, the New York Times would compliment the breadth of King’s literary knowledge even while panning his epic best-seller The Stand.) </p>
<p> “Here you are, one of the best- selling authors in all of history,” Stahl continued, “and the critics cannot find much that they like in your work.” </p>
<p> To this, King replied, “All I can say is — and this is in response to the critics who've often said that my work is awkward and sometimes a little bit painful — I know it. I'm doing the best I can with what I've got.” </p>
<p> While King’s self-deprecation may have been a mark of respect for his critics, those critics were on the cusp of being proven wrong. This was in large part thanks to the sleeping giant that became The Shawshank Redemption, which drew popular attention to the fact that King could do more than “just” write horror, and helped kick-start critical reassessment of him and his work. </p>
<p> The film, written by longtime Stephen King adapter Frank Darabont, is based on one of King’s most literary works, a 1982 novella about an agonizingly slow prison break. Shawshank flopped when it opened in theaters in 1994, but it was nominated for seven Academy Awards — more than any other King adaptation. As indicated by its long reign as the highest-ranked film on IMDB, it has gone on to become one of the most popular and beloved films ever made. </p>
<p> By 1998, under the oversight of a new publisher, King’s books were actively being marketed as literary fiction for the first time. From the mid-’90s through today, King’s critical and cultural reputation has advanced as thoroughly as it stagnated before. </p>
<p> In a 2013 CBS interview, we see the marked difference with which contemporary media has come to view King’s work: “You used to always get slotted in the Horror genre,” interviewer Anthony Mason commented to King. “And I think it was sort of a way of some people, I think, not treating you all that seriously as a writer.” </p>
<p> “I don't know if I want to be treated seriously per se, because in the end posterity decides whether it's good work or whether it's lasting work,” King replied, secure in his position as one of the best-loved authors of the 20th century. </p>
<p> But evolving cultural views on genre fiction aside, King’s writing has always displayed significant literary qualities, particularly ongoing literary themes that have shaped how we understand horror as well as ourselves. </p>
<p> The horror of Stephen King doesn’t lie with the external but with the internal </p>
<p> In his award-winning 1981 collection of essays on horror, Danse Macabre, King names three emotions that belong to the realm of the horror genre: terror, horror, and revulsion. He argues that while all three emotions are of equal value to the creation of horror, the “finest” and most worthy is terror because it rests on the creator’s ability to command audiences’ imaginations. Drawing on numerous writers before him, he posits that never fully revealing the source of the horror is the best way to effect terror upon the mind. </p>
<p> King argues that the art of making us terrified about what lies around the corner is all about getting us to identify with the characters who are experiencing the terror. If we don’t care about the characters, then it won’t matter how many jump scares you fling at the audience — we have to be at least a little invested in their fate. </p>
<p> As such, King spends a great deal of time on characters’ interior lives, often jumping between different point-of-view characters throughout his novels. (For example, Salem’s Lot, It, and The Stand are all stories with large ensemble casts and multiple shifting points of view.) But every characterization, even a minor one, is rich with detail; even if you just met a new character, you can bet that by the time he or she meets a grisly ending a few pages later, you’ll have a deep understanding of who that character is. </p>
<p> King’s novels often contain deeply flawed yet sympathetic central characters surrounded by large ensemble casts full of equally flawed people, each struggling to interact and grapple with larger forces. By framing his stories within an interwoven web of narrative perspectives and juxtaposed character experiences, King is able to generate a feeling of interconnectivity, as well as explore the various literary themes that stretch throughout his multidimensional universe, including but not limited to: </p>
<p> 1) Nerdboys to men </p>
<p> King credits his absentee father for bequeathing him a love of horror via a stash of pulp novels King discovered as a boy. But another lasting legacy of this truncated relationship was King’s ongoing preoccupation with relationships between men and boys, the process of attaining manhood, and the bridge between boyhood and adulthood. </p>
<p> We see these bonds take a variety of shapes and meaning throughout his work, ranging from comforting (Salem’s Lot) to destructive (Apt Pupil) to ambiguous (The Shining). King explores male intimacy through these relationships, frequently challenging typical masculine forms of expression. He can do this because his boys and men tend to be nerds and outcasts who already exist outside traditional masculine norms. The bookish nerdy kid was relatively uncommon in mainstream adult fiction before King came along; now we recognize such characters as hallmarks of genre literature. </p>
<p> To King, the social markers that make kids outcasts in school — from being nerdy to being overweight to enduring acne — also make them uniquely outfitted to be conduits for readers’ social anxieties and fears. Because deep down, we’re all reliving the social terrors of school every day of our lives. </p>
<p> 2) Creative struggles and struggles with addiction </p>
<p> King frequently writes about the process of creation, often by exploring an artist who’s been prevented from creating in some way. The main characters of Salem’s Lot, The Shining, Misery, The Dark Half, Bag of Bones, 1408, and numerous short stories are all writers who’ve been in some way prevented from writing or thwarted in their creative efforts. Many of these and other artistic characters mirror King’s own real-life experiences; for example, the artist at the center of 2008’s Duma Key reflects his physical struggle to write following a highly publicized 1999 injury that made writing difficult for several years. </p>
<p> King has also been open throughout his career about his struggles with addictions ranging from alcohol to drug abuse to painkillers, and many of his main characters likewise struggle with addiction — either directly, in books like The Shining and Revival, or indirectly: The villain of Misery, Annie Wilkes, is a metaphor for cocaine itself. </p>
<p> 3) World building through geography and repeated characters </p>
<p> Most people associate Stephen King with Maine and Maine with Stephen King. This is because King almost exclusively writes and sets his stories there. The town of Derry, for example, where It lives, is based on Bangor, Maine. Numerous fictional King towns, like Derry, Haven (the location of a 2010 TV series based on King’s mystery novel The Colorado Kid), and Castle Rock, exist in his works alongside real towns. </p>
<p> King uses these locations to increase the verisimilitude of his stories, painting them as all part of the same fictional universe. In stories like It, he borrows liberally from real places and landmarks, highways and scenery, even real street corners. And while Derry is the most famous of King’s fictional towns, Castle Rock is his most frequent destination, showing up over and over in his works. </p>
<p> King doesn’t only reuse places in his stories, however — he also reuses people. One popular villain, a recurring supernatural figure who may or may not be the devil, appears throughout the Stephen King universe in various guises. In The Dark Tower he’s “the Man in Black”; to the lost souls in The Stand, he’s a leader named Randall Flagg. In other stories, he’s a nebulous cast of characters with the initials “R.F.” </p>
<p> Frequently throughout his books, King will signal that his worlds are all connected by having characters meet characters from other books in passing. King characters also are frequently able to travel between narrative landscapes, with or without their awareness (The Shining, Gerald’s Game, Bag of Bones, Lisey’s Story). This interconnectivity becomes the central conceit of the Dark Tower, which explicitly links most of King’s stories together in one vast multiverse and explains that there are metaphysical doors between the worlds that allow all this to happen. </p>
<p> King’s work endures not because of its inherent darkness but because of its inherent hope </p>
<p> Part of the reason it may have taken critics so long to reassess King’s work is that “horror” implies the lower rungs of emotion King speaks of in Danse Macabre — the gross-outs and the physical gags that play into our understanding of the genre. But the key to his popularity as a horror novelist, and as a novelist in general, resides not in the darkest moments of his writing, but in his basic belief in humanity’s innate goodness. </p>
<p> He spells out his essentially hopeful, fundamentally romantic worldview in a 1989 interview: </p>
<p> There must be a huge store of good will in the human race. ... If there weren’t this huge store of good will we would have blown ourselves to hell ten years after World War II was over. </p>
<p> ... It’s such a common thing, those feelings of love toward your fellow man, that we hardly ever talk about it; we concentrate on the other things. It’s just there; it’s all around us, so I guess we take it for granted ... </p>
<p> I believe all those sappy, romantic things: Children are good, good wins out over evil, it is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. I see a lot of the so-called “romantic ideal” at work in the world around us. </p>
<p> It’s this core optimism, more than his ability to scare us, that makes King so beloved by readers. Even in his bleakest works, he retains his ability to empathize deeply with his characters, and to see even his monsters as fundamentally human. </p>

<p> Stephen King’s office building sits on a particularly dreary dead-end road on the outskirts of Bangor, Maine, just down the street from a gun-and-ammo store, a snowplow dealership and, appropriately enough, an old cemetery. From the outside, the anonymous building looks like a new branch of Dunder Mifflin, a very deliberate choice meant to keep King and his tiny staff safe. “We can’t be on a main road because people would find us,” says one of his assistants. “And it’s not people you want to find you. He draws some weird people.” </p>
<p> Once buzzed in, a visitor enters a sort of Stephen King nirvana – rooms decorated with fan-created artwork populated with characters from his novels, a Stephen King Simpsons action figure, a freakish bobble-head doll of the demented clown from his 1986 book IT, and piles and piles of books. He keeps an old Gothic house (complete with spiderwebs and bats on the front gate) just a few miles away that draws bus loads of tourists, but he’s virtually never there. Most of the year, he lives two and a half hours away in Lovell, Maine, and now with his three kids grown, he and his wife, Tabitha, head down to Sarasota, Florida, at the height of winter. </p>
<p> Related </p>
<p> King himself only comes into the office about once a month, but today he stopped by and, as usual, he’s juggling a lot of projects at once. He just polished off a final draft of his upcoming serial-killer book Finders Keepers (a sequel to his recent work Mr. Mercedes), a pretty astonishing feat considering he will also release two books this year, write a screenplay for the new Joan Allen/Anthony LaPaglia film A Good Marriage and continue to fine-tune Ghost Brothers of Darkland County, a musical he wrote with John Mellencamp. </p>
<p> But right now, the 67-year-old is hunched over an easy chair in his office, chomping on a doughnut that’s leaving a growing pile of powdered sugar on his black turtleneck shirt. He’s excited about the upcoming publication of Revival, a modern-day Frankenstein story about a preacher who’s obsessed with the healing powers of electricity and his 50-year relationship with a drug-addled rock guitarist. It’s basically guaranteed to land at Number One on The New York Times bestseller list. </p>
<p> Since 1974, when Carrie hit shelves, King has sold an estimated 350 million books, and he’s now worth hundreds of millions of dollars. John Grisham and Fifty Shades of Grey author E.L. James may outsell him these days, but it’s hardly a problem. “He’s not competitive,” says his longtime agent Chuck Verrill. “The only guy he ever cared about was Tom Clancy. They were both at Penguin once, and it was made clear to King that he was seen as the second banana to Clancy. He didn’t like that, but he’s very content where he is right now.” </p>
<p> King hasn’t done many recent in-depth print interviews since a van accident nearly killed him 15 years ago, but he decided to sit down with Rolling Stone to discuss his life and career. </p>
<p> The vast majority of your books deal with either horror or the supernatural. What drew you toward those subjects? It’s built in. That’s all. The first movie I ever saw was a horror movie. It was Bambi. When that little deer gets caught in a forest fire, I was terrified, but I was also exhilarated. I can’t explain it. My wife and kids drink coffee. But I don’t. I like tea. My wife and kids won’t touch a pizza with anchovies on it. But I like anchovies. The stuff I was drawn to was built in as part of my equipment. </p>
<p> Did you ever feel shame about that? No. I thought it was great fun to scare people. I also knew it was socially acceptable because there were a lot of horror movies out there. And I cut my teeth on horror comics like The Crypt of Terror. </p>
<p> By writing horror novels, you entered one of the least respected genres of fiction. Yeah. It’s one of the genres that live across the tracks in the literary community, but what could I do? That’s where I was drawn. I love D.H. Lawrence. And James Dickey’s poetry, Émile Zola, Steinbeck . . . Fitzgerald, not so much. Hemingway, not at all. Hemingway sucks, basically. If people like that, terrific. But if I set out to write that way, what would’ve come out would’ve been hollow and lifeless because it wasn’t me. And I have to say this: To a degree, I have elevated the horror genre. </p>
<p> Few would argue with that. It’s more respected now. I’ve spoken out my whole life against the idea of simply dismissing whole areas of fiction by saying it’s “genre” and therefore can’t be seen as literature. I’m not trying to be conceited or anything. Raymond Chandler elevated the detective genre. People who have done wonderful work really blur the line. </p>
<p> Hemingway sucks. If I set out to write that way, it would have been been hollow and lifeless because it wasn’t me. </p>
<p> A lot of critics were pretty brutal to you when you were starting out. Early in my career, The Village Voice did a caricature of me that hurts even today when I think about it. It was a picture of me eating money. I had this big, bloated face. It was this assumption that if fiction was selling a lot of copies, it was bad. If something is accessible to a lot of people, it’s got to be dumb because most people are dumb. And that’s elitist. I don’t buy it. </p>
<p> But that attitude continues to this day. Literary critic Harold Bloom viciously ripped into you when you won the National Book Award about 10 years ago. Bloom never pissed me off because there are critics out there, and he’s one of them, who take their ignorance about popular culture as a badge of intellectual prowess. He might be able to say that Mark Twain is a great writer, but it’s impossible for him to say that there’s a direct line of descent from, say, Nathaniel Hawthorne to Jim Thompson because he doesn’t read guys like Thompson. He just thinks, “I never read him, but I know he’s terrible.” </p>
<p> Michiko Kakutani, who writes reviews for The New York Times, is the same way. She’ll review a book like David Mitchell’s The Bone Clocks, which is one of the best novels of the year. It’s as good as Donna Tartt’s The Goldfinch, has the same kind of deep literary resonance. But because it has elements of fantasy and science fiction, Kakutani doesn’t want to understand it. In that sense, Bloom and Kakutani and a number of gray eminences in literary criticism are like children who say, “I can’t possibly eat this meal because the different kinds of food are touching on the plate!” </p>
<p> Film critics can look at a popular movie like Jaws and heap praise upon it, then in another section of the paper, the critics will bash you for The Stand. By its very nature, film is supposed to be an accessible medium to everybody. Let’s face it, you can take a fucking illiterate to Jaws and he can understand what’s going on. I don’t know who the Harold Bloom of the film world is, but if you found someone like that and said to him, “Compare Jaws with 400 Blows by Francois Truffaut,” he’d just laugh and say, “Well, Jaws is a piece of crappy, popular entertainment, but 400 Blows is cinema.” It’s the same elitism. </p>
<p> Switching gears, your new book Revival talks a lot about religion. Specifically, one of the two main characters is a reverend that turns on God when his family dies but also delivers a sermon about why religion is a complete fraud. How much of that sermon mirrors your own beliefs? My view is that organized religion is a very dangerous tool that’s been misused by a lot of people. I grew up in a Methodist church, and we went to services every Sunday and to Bible school in the summer. We didn’t have a choice. We just did it. So all that stuff about childhood religion in Revival is basically autobiographical. But as a kid, I had doubts. When I went to Methodist youth fellowship, we were taught that the Catholics were all going to go to hell because they worship idols. So right there, I’m saying to myself, “Catholics are going to go to hell, but my aunt Molly married a Catholic and she converted and she’s got 11 kids and they’re all pretty nice and one of them’s my good friend – they’re all going to go to hell?” I’m thinking to myself, “This is bullshit.” And if that’s bullshit, how much of the rest of it is bullshit? </p>
<p> Did you relay any of your doubts to your mother? Jesus, no! I loved her. I never would have done that. Once I got through high school, that was it for me. When you see somebody like Jimmy Swaggart and he’s supposed to be this great minister touched by God, and he’s paying whores because he wants to look up their dresses, it’s just all hypocrisy. </p>
<p> All that said, you’ve made it clear over the years that you still believe in God. Yeah. I choose to believe in God because it makes things better. You have a meditation point, a source of strength. I don’t ask myself, “Well, does God exist or does God not exist?” I choose to believe that God exists, and therefore I can say, “God, I can’t do this by myself. Help me not to take a drink today. Help me not to take a drug today.” And that works fine for me. </p>
<p> Do you believe in the afterlife? I don’t know. I’m totally agnostic on that one. Let’s put it this way, I would like to believe that there is some sort of an afterlife. I do believe that when we’re in the process of dying, that all these emergency circuits in the brain take over. I base what I’m saying not on any empirical evidence. I think it’s very possible that when you’re dying, these circuits open up, which would explain this whole white-light phenomena – when people clinically die and they see their relatives and stuff and say, “Hello, it’s great to see you.” </p>
<p> Do you hope to go to heaven? I don’t want to go to the heaven that I learned about when I was a kid. To me, it seems boring. The idea that you’re going to lounge around on a cloud all day and listen to guys play harps? I don’t want to listen to harps. I want to listen to Jerry Lee Lewis! </p>
<p> Do you wish you had stronger beliefs? Would that give you comfort if you had more certainty? No, I think uncertainty is good for things. Certainty breeds complacency and complacency means that you just sit somewhere in your nice little comfortable suburban house in Michigan, looking at CNN and saying, “Oh, those poor immigrant children that are all coming across the border. But we really can’t have them here – that isn’t what God wants. Let’s send them all back to the drug cartels.” There’s a complacency to it. </p>
<p> How about evil? Do you believe there is such a thing? I believe in evil, but all my life I’ve gone back and forth about whether or not there’s an outside evil, whether or not there’s a force in the world that really wants to destroy us, from the inside out, individually and collectively. Or whether it all comes from inside and that it’s all part of genetics and environment. When you find somebody like, let’s say, Ted Bundy, who tortured and killed all those women and sometimes went back and had sex with the dead bodies, I don’t think when you look at his upbringing you can say, “Oh, that’s because Mommy put a clothespin on his dick when he was four.” That behavior was hard-wired. Evil is inside us. The older I get, the less I think there’s some sort of outside devilish influence; it comes from people. And unless we’re able to address that issue, sooner or later, we’ll fucking kill ourselves. </p>
<p> Misery is a book about cocaine. Annie Wilkes is cocaine. She was my number-one fan. </p>
<p> What do you mean? I read a thing on Huffington Post about a month ago that stayed with me. It was very troubling. It was a pop-science thing, which is all I can understand. It said we’ve been listening to the stars for 50 years, looking for any signs of life, and there’s been nothing but silence. When you see what’s going on in the world today, and you have all this conflict, and our technological expertise has far outraced our ability to manage our own emotions – you see it right now with ISIS – what’s the solution? The only solution we see with ISIS is to bomb the shit out of those motherfuckers so that they just can’t roll over the world. And that’s what’s scary about that silence – maybe all intelligent races hit this level of violence and technological advances that they can’t get past. And then they just puff out. You hit the wall and that’s it. </p>
<p> So you think humanity’s destiny is to someday wipe itself out? I can’t see the future, but it’s grim. The depletion of resources – we’re living in this dine-and-dash economy. I love the Republicans, too. Whenever it comes to money – the national debt, for instance – they yell their heads off about “What about our grandchildren?” But when it comes to the environment, when it comes to resources, they’re like, “We’ll be OK for 40 years.” </p>
<p> I want to talk about writing now. Walk me through your typical day when you’re working on a book. I wake up. I eat breakfast. I walk about three and a half miles. I come back, I go out to my little office, where I’ve got a manuscript, and the last page that I was happy with is on top. I read that, and it’s like getting on a taxiway. I’m able to go through and revise it and put myself – click – back into that world, whatever it is. I don’t spend the day writing. I’ll maybe write fresh copy for two hours, and then I’ll go back and revise some of it and print what I like and then turn it off. </p>
<p> Do you do that every day? Every day, even weekends. I used to write more and I used to write faster – it’s just aging. It slows you down a little bit. </p>
<p> Is writing an addiction for you? Yeah. Sure. I love it. And it’s one of the few things where I do it less now and get as much out of it. Usually with dope and booze, you do it more and get less out of it as time goes by. It’s still really good, but it’s addictive, obsessive-compulsive behavior. So I’ll write every day for maybe six months and get a draft of something – and then I make myself stop completely for 10 days or 12 days in order to let everything settle. But during that time off, I drive my wife crazy. She says, “Get out of my way, get out of the house, go do something – paint a birdhouse, anything!” </p>
<p> So I watch TV, I play my guitar and put in time, and then when I go to bed at night, I have all these crazy dreams, usually not very pleasant ones because whatever machinery that you have that goes into writing stories, it doesn’t want to stop. So if it’s not going on the page, it has to go somewhere, and I have these mind dreams. They’re always dreams that focus on some kind of shame or insecurity. </p>
<p> Like what? The one that recurs is that I’m going to be in a play, and I get to the theater and it’s opening night and not only can I not find my costume, but I realize that I have never learned the lines. </p>
<p> How do you interpret that? It’s just insecurity – fear of failure, fear of falling short. </p>
<p> You still fear failure after all these years of success? Sure. I’m afraid of all kinds of things. I’m afraid of failing at whatever story I’m writing – that it won’t come up for me, or that I won’t be able to finish it. </p>
<p> Do you think your imagination is more active than most people’s? I don’t know, man. It’s more trained. It hurts to imagine stuff. It can give you a headache. Probably doesn’t hurt physically, but it hurts mentally. But the more that you can do it, the more you’re able to get out of it. Everybody has that capacity, but I don’t think everyone develops it. </p>
<p> Fair enough, but not many people can do what you do. I can remember as a college student writing stories and novels, some of which ended up getting published and some that didn’t. It was like my head was going to burst – there were so many things I wanted to write all at once. I had so many ideas, jammed up. It was like they just needed permission to come out. I had this huge aquifer underneath of stories that I wanted to tell and I stuck a pipe down in there and everything just gushed out. There’s still a lot of it, but there’s not as much now. </p>
<p> When did you first get the idea for Revival? I’ve had it since I was a kid, really. I read this story called The Great God Pan in high school, and there were these two characters waiting to see if this woman could come back from the dead and tell them what was over there. It just creeped me out. The more I thought about it, the more I thought about this Mary Shelley-Frankenstein thing. </p>
<p> How long did it take you to write it? I started it in Maine and finished it in Florida. An actual book takes at least a year. A first draft can be rough, and then you polish it, take out the bad stuff. Elmore Leonard – someone asked him, “How do you write a book someone wants to read?” And he said, “You leave out the boring shit.” </p>
<p> Do you put some of yourself into the character of Jamie? Yeah, sure. Jamie is a guy who gets addicted to drugs after a motorcycle accident, and I’ve had a drug problem ever since, man, I don’t know. I guess I’ve had a drug problem since college. </p>
<p> You had a major drinking problem, too. When did that become an issue? I started drinking by age 18. I realized I had a problem around the time that Maine became the first state in the nation to pass a returnable-bottle-and-can law. You could no longer just toss the shit away, you saved it, and you turned it in to a recycling center. And nobody in the house drank but me. My wife would have a glass of wine and that was all. So I went in the garage one night, and the trash can that was set aside for beer cans was full to the top. </p>
<p> It had been empty the week before. I was drinking, like, a case of beer a night. And I thought, “I’m an alcoholic.” That was probably about ’78, ’79. I thought, “I’ve gotta be really careful, because if somebody says, ‘You’re drinking too much, you have to quit,’ I won’t be able to.” </p>
<p> Were you buzzed when you wrote in the morning back then? Not really. I didn’t drink in the days. Sometimes if I had, like, two things going – which I did a lot, sometimes I still do – I would work at night. And if I was working at night, I was looped. But I never wrote original stuff at night, I just rewrote. It turned out all right. </p>
<p> At what point did hard drugs enter the picture? It was probably about ’78, around the same time that I realized that I was out of control with drinking. Well, I thought I was in control, but in reality I wasn’t. </p>
<p> That was cocaine? Yeah, coke. I was a heavy user from 1978 until 1986, something like that. </p>
<p> Did you write on coke? Oh, yeah, I had to. I mean, coke was different from booze. Booze, I could wait, and I didn’t drink or anything. But I used coke all the time. </p>
<p> You had three young kids at the time. It must have been very stressful to keep this huge secret while balancing all your responsibilities. I don’t remember. </p>
<p> Really? No. That whole time is pretty hazy to me. I just didn’t use it around people. And I wasn’t a social drinker. I used to say that I didn’t want to go to bars because they were full of assholes like me. </p>
<p> I’m trying to comprehend how you lived this whole secret life of a drug addict for eight years, all the while churning out bestsellers and being a family man. Well, I can’t comprehend it now, either, but you do what you have to do. And when you’re an addict, you have to use. So you just try to balance things out as best you can. But little by little, the family life started to show cracks. </p>
<p> I was usually pretty good about it. I was able to get up and make the kids breakfast and get them off to school. And I was strong; I had a lot of energy. I would’ve killed myself otherwise. But the books start to show it after a while. Misery is a book about cocaine. Annie Wilkes is cocaine. She was my number-one fan. </p>
<p> Did the quality of your writing start to go down? Yeah, it did. I mean, The Tommyknockers is an awful book. That was the last one I wrote before I cleaned up my act. And I’ve thought about it a lot lately and said to myself, “There’s really a good book in here, underneath all the sort of spurious energy that cocaine provides, and I ought to go back.” The book is about 700 pages long, and I’m thinking, “There’s probably a good 350-page novel in there.” </p>
<p> Is The Tommyknockers the one book in your catalog you think you botched? Well, I don’t like Dreamcatcher very much. Dreamcatcher was written after the accident. [In 1999, King was hit by a van while taking a walk and left severely injured.] I was using a lot of Oxycontin for pain. And I couldn’t work on a computer back then because it hurt too much to sit in that position. So I wrote the whole thing longhand. And I was pretty stoned when I wrote it, because of the Oxy, and that’s another book that shows the drugs at work. </p>
<p> If you had to pick your best book, what would it be? Lisey’s Story. That one felt like an important book to me because it was about marriage, and I’d never written about that. I wanted to talk about two things: One is the secret world that people build inside a marriage, and the other was that even in that intimate world, there’s still things that we don’t know about each other. </p>
<p> Are you done writing Dark Tower books? I’m never done with The Dark Tower. The thing about The Dark Tower is that those books were never edited, so I look at them as first drafts. And by the time I got to the fifth or sixth book, I’m thinking to myself, “This is really all one novel.” It drives me crazy. The thing is to try to find the time to rewrite them. There’s a missing element – a big battle at a place called Jericho Hill. And that whole thing should be written, and I’ve thought about it several times, and I don’t know how to get into it. </p>
<p> You’ve made a fortune over the years. A lot of people would be living it up, buying houses in Hawaii and the South of France and filling them with Picassos. That’s obviously not your thing, so what does your money do for you? I like to have money to buy books and go to movies and buy music and stuff. To me, the greatest thing in the world is downloading TV shows on iTunes because there are no commercials, and yet if I were a working stiff, I could never afford to do this. But I don’t even think about money. I have two amazing things in my life: I’m pain-free and I’m debt-free. Money means I can support my family and still do what I love. Not very many people can say that in this world, and not many writers can say that. I’m not a clothes person. I’m not a boat person. We do have a house in Florida. But we live in Maine, for Christ’s sake. It’s not like a trendy community or anything. We have the houses and stuff. My wife likes all that. But I’m not very interested in stuff. I like cars, because I grew up in the country and a car was important. So we’ve got more cars than we need, but that’s our biggest extravagance. </p>
<p> When you look at these hedge-fund guys just living like kings . . . Totally foreign to me. I saw The Wolf of Wall Street, and it looked to me like this guy was living this sort of exhausting lifestyle. Money for the sake of money doesn’t interest me. There’s a lot of it, and we give a lot of it away. </p>
<p> I’ve read that you make large charitable donations, but you almost never hear about where it goes. We were raised firmly to believe that if you give away money and you make a big deal of it so that everybody sees it, that’s hubris. You do it for yourself, and you’re not supposed to make a big deal about it. We have publicly acknowledged certain contributions, but the idea behind that is to say to other people, “This is the example we’re trying to make, so we wish that you would do the same thing.” </p>
<p> So if you give away $1 million to Eastern Maine General Hospital here, you’re doing it because you’re hoping that somebody else will chip in. I’m not averse to using whatever celebrity that I have. I’m going to do a TV ad for the Democratic candidate Shenna Bellows this afternoon. She’s running against Susan Collins for Senate. And I don’t know how much goodwill I have in the state, but I think it’s a fair amount, so maybe the ad will make a difference. </p>
<p> Do you worry that being too political will turn off some of your readers? It happens all the time. I wrote an e-book after the thing in Newtown, Connecticut, when that guy shot all those kids. I got a lot of letters, somebody saying, “Asshole! I’ll never read another one of your goddamn books.” So what? If you’re to a point where you can’t separate the entertainment from the politics, who needs you? Jesus Christ. </p>
<p> I never really cared for Tom Clancy’s books, but it wasn’t because he was a Republican guy. It was because I didn’t think he could write. There’s another guy that I sense is probably a fairly right-wing writer. His name is Stephen Hunter. And I love his books. I don’t think he likes mine. </p>
<p> Your father walked out when you were two. How much did his absence shape your life? I don’t know. I don’t live an examined life, but I can remember when Tabby and I got married, back in ’71. I can remember laying in bed with her and turning over and saying, “We ought to get married.” And she said, “Let me think about it overnight.” </p>
<p> And in the morning, she said, “Yeah, we should get married.” We had nothing. I mean, I was working at a gas station. I was pumping gas. And then when I graduated from school, she was still in school. Then when I got a job working at a wet-wash laundry because I couldn’t get a teaching job, we had jack shit for money. She was working in a Dunkin’ Donuts when I finally got a teaching job. We didn’t have a phone in the house, and we had two babies. Don’t ask me why we did that. I can’t remember what the mindset was there. </p>
<p> Looking back, would you do it all over again? We must have been fucking crazy, but I love those kids, and I’m glad we did it. She would go to work at Dunkin’ Donuts. She looked cute in the little pink uniform. God, she was so good-looking. She’s still good-looking to me, but oh, my God. And there was something sexy about all that pink nylon. </p>
<p> She would bring home the empty buckets of filling from the doughnuts, and we used them as diaper pails. So I would teach school, come home, she’d work at Dunkin’ Donuts. I would baby-sit the kids and give them the bottles and change them and everything until she came home at 11:00. And then we’d go to bed. And I’m thinking to myself, “I’m not going to leave this marriage no matter what happens.” </p>
<p> Your dad died in 1980. Were you ever tempted to meet him, if only to hear his side of the story? No. I was curious when I was a kid. I used to think, “I’d like to find him and knock his fucking head off.” And then later on, I thought to myself, “I’d like to find him and hear his side of the story and then knock his fucking head off.” Because there’s no excuse for it. It wasn’t just that he walked out and left us – he left her holding a whole bunch of bills, which she worked to pay off. </p>
<p> What stopped you? I was too busy. I was trying to carve out a career as a writer. And when I was teaching school, I would teach and come home and try to steal a couple of hours to write. To tell you the truth, man, I never thought about it that much. </p>
<p> Did you see that new documentary “Room 237” about obsessive fans of Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining? Yeah. Well, let me put it this way – I watched about half of it and got sort of impatient with it and turned it off. </p>
<p> Why? These guys were reaching. I’ve never had much patience for academic bullshit. It’s like Dylan says, “You give people a lot of knives and forks, they’ve gotta cut something.” And that was what was going on in that movie. </p>
<p> You’ve been extremely critical of Kubrick’s film over the years. Is it possible he made a great movie that just so happens to be a horrible adaptation of your book? No. I never saw it that way at all. And I never see any of the movies that way. The movies have never been a big deal to me. The movies are the movies. They just make them. If they’re good, that’s terrific. If they’re not, they’re not. But I see them as a lesser medium than fiction, than literature, and a more ephemeral medium. </p>
<p> Are you mystified by the cult that’s grown around Kubrick’s Shining? I don’t get it. But there are a lot of things that I don’t get. But obviously people absolutely love it, and they don’t understand why I don’t. The book is hot, and the movie is cold; the book ends in fire, and the movie in ice. In the book, there’s an actual arc where you see this guy, Jack Torrance, trying to be good, and little by little he moves over to this place where he’s crazy. And as far as I was concerned, when I saw the movie, Jack was crazy from the first scene. I had to keep my mouth shut at the time. It was a screening, and Nicholson was there. But I’m thinking to myself the minute he’s on the screen, “Oh, I know this guy. I’ve seen him in five motorcycle movies, where Jack Nicholson played the same part.” And it’s so misogynistic. I mean, Wendy Torrance is just presented as this sort of screaming dishrag. But that’s just me, that’s the way I am. </p>
<p> What’s the best movie ever made from one of your books? Probably Stand by Me. I thought it was true to the book, and because it had the emotional gradient of the story. It was moving. I think I scared the shit out of Rob Reiner. He showed it to me in the screening room at the Beverly Hills Hotel. I was out there for something else, and he said, “Can I come over and show you this movie?” And you have to remember that the movie was made on a shoestring. It was supposed to be one of those things that opened in six theaters and then maybe disappeared. And instead it went viral. When the movie was over, I hugged him because I was moved to tears, because it was so autobiographical. </p>
<p> But Stand by Me, Shawshank Redemption, Green Mile are all really great ones. Misery is a great film. Delores Claiborne is a really, really good film. Cujo is terrific. </p>
<p> What do you make of this surge in sales for young-adult books? There’s a whole school of critics that say too many adults are reading them. It’s just crazy. I read all of the Harry Potter books, and I really liked ’em. I don’t approach any books in terms of genre saying that “This is young adult,” or “This is a romance,” or science fiction, or whatever. You read them because you read them. Someone asked me recently, “Have you ever considered writing a book for young people? You know, a YA novel?” And I said, “All of them.” Because I don’t see that genre thing. </p>
<p> Do you think you have fewer young readers than you had back in the first few decades of your career? Yes, that’s probably true. I’m seen as somebody who writes for adults because I’m an older man myself. Some of them find me, and a lot of them don’t. But I came along at a fortunate time, in that I was a paperback success before I was a hardcover success. That’s because paperbacks were cheap, so a lot of readers that I had were younger people. Paperbacks were what they could afford. You do say to yourself, “Well, are the younger readers coming along in terms of the e-books, the Kindles and all that stuff?” And the answer is, some of them are, but a lot of them probably aren’t. </p>
<p> Does that bother you? Well, I have a drive to succeed. I have a drive to want to please people, as many people as possible. But that ends at a certain point where you say, “I’m not going to sell out and write this one particular kind of thing.” I had a real argument with myself about Mr. Mercedes, which is basically a straight suspense novel. </p>
<p> I had to sit down and have a discussion with myself and say, “Do you want to do what your heart is telling you you should do, or do you want to do what people expect? Because if you only want to write what people expect, what the fuck did you do all this for? Why don’t you write what you want to write?” </p>
<p> Do you worry about the death of print? I think books are going to be around, but it’s crazy what happened. They’re worried in the publishing industry about bookstores disappearing. Barnes & Noble creating the Nook was like Vietnam; they should have left that alone because Amazon got there first with the Kindle. The death of the music business was insane, but audio recordings have been around now for maybe 120 years. Books have been around for, what, nine centuries? So they’re more entrenched than music. </p>
<p> Speaking of Harry Potter, you’ve become friendly with J.K. Rowling, right? Yeah. We did a charity event at Radio City Music Hall a few years back. She was working on the last of the Harry Potter books. Her publicist and her editor called her over, and they talked for about 10 minutes. And when she came back to me, she was steaming. Fucking furious. And she said, “They don’t understand what we do, do they? They don’t fucking understand what we do.” And I said, “No, they don’t. None of them do.” And that’s what my life is like right now. </p>
<p> What do you mean? When someone says, “What are you working on?” I’ll say, “I’ve got this wonderful story about these two families on two sides of a lake that end up having this arms race with fireworks,” but I’m doing this event, and then I’ve got the political ad and all this other crap. So you have to be stern about it and say, “I’m not going to do this other stuff, because you’ve got to make room for me to write.” Nobody really understands what the job is. They want the books, but they don’t, in a way, take it seriously. </p>
<p> You mentioned watching a lot of TV. What’s the best show of the past 15 years? Breaking Bad. I knew it was great from the first scene you see him wearing jockey shorts. I thought it was amazingly brave since they look so geeky. </p>
<p> Do you think if you had been born at a later time you would have wanted to work as a TV showrunner? No. Too much time for too little payoff. I don’t mean in terms of money. Also, showrunning is a thing where you have to work with tons of different people. You have to schmooze people, you have to talk to network people. I don’t want to do any of that. </p>
<p> It’s interesting that mainstream movies are worse than ever, but TV just gets better and better. Yeah. I mean, we aren’t talking about shows like NCIS and CSI that basically show one story over and over. I’m not even talking about Mad Men, which I don’t like. But Breaking Bad, Sons of Anarchy, The Walking Dead, The Bridge, The Americans. Those things are so textured and so involving that they make movies look like short stories. I was watching a show 12 years ago called The Shield. And in the first episode, Michael Chiklis, who played the protagonist, turns around and kills a fellow cop. And I thought to myself, “TV just underwent this seismic change.” That show was the most important show on television. Breaking Bad is better, but The Shield changed everything. </p>
<p> Let’s talk about music. Revival is about a rock guitarist. Do you think that could have been your path if you had a little more natural musical talent? Sure! I love music, and I can play a little. But anyone can see the difference between someone who’s talented and someone that’s not. The main character in Revival, Jamie, just has natural talent. What he can do on the guitar, I can do when I write. It just pours out. Nobody taught me. In Revival, I took what I know about how it feels to write and applied it to music. </p>
<p> What’s the best concert you ever saw? Springsteen. I went to see him at the Ice Arena in Lewiston, Maine, in 1977. He played for about four hours. It was fantastic. There’s so much energy, so much generosity in the show, and so much real life in the music. He was totally athletic, and he’d jump into the crowd, lay on his back and spin around. He was a great showman. </p>
<p> Do you respect him as a storyteller? I respect him as a songwriter and the insight in his songs. My favorite album of his is Nebraska. I knew from the beginning of “Atlantic City” that it was amazing. He had really grown as a songwriter. He’s done stuff in music that nobody else has done. That line in “The River,” “Now I just act like I don’t remember, and Mary acts like she don’t care.” Let’s put it this way, it’s a long way from “Palisades Park” by Freddy Cannon. </p>
<p> I feel like you and Bruce would both be doing what you’re doing, even if you weren’t paid for it. Yeah, I think it’s fair. And it’d be fair to say that we were both self-taught with a lot of ambition, a lot of drive to succeed, because I have that in me too. I have this one thing that I can do, and that’s something Bruce expresses in a lot of his music. </p>
<p> Do you think President Obama is doing a good job? Under the circumstances, he’s been terrific. Look at how much improvement there’s been with the job situation. But it’s human nature to care about unresolved issues. And so this business with ISIS, or people breaking into the White House, this becomes, for some reason, Obama’s fault somehow. </p>
<p> Do you think Obama is right to go after ISIS like this? If they’re as bad as the press says. I mean, they’re cutting off heads in public and blowing up shit – something’s got to be done to those guys. That’s my feeling anyway, and I’m a pacifist. It’s depressing ’cause it’s like 1984 all over again: constant war – it’s never going to end. </p>
<p> Why do you think the country is so divided? It doesn’t have anything to do with Obama. There’s a fundamental discussion going on in America right now about whether or not we’re going to continue to protect individual freedoms or whether we’re going to give some of them up. And the discussion has become extremely acrimonious. </p>
<p> In the wake of 9/11, we’re searched invasively at airports. There are CCTV cameras everywhere. There’s a whole bunch of people who say that America is for the individual and that we’re all the gunslingers of our own house. Basically, there’s a whole side of the country that’s fearful. They’re fearful that if same-sex marriage becomes legal, then God knows what will happen – all at once, all of our kids will be gay and America’s way of life will die out. They’re afraid that immigrants are going to swamp the economy. And on the other side, there are all of those people who say, “Maybe there’s a way to embrace these things, and maybe we need to give up our right that anybody can buy a gun.” They’re basic arguments. </p>
<p> Do you think much about what your legacy will be? No, not very much. For one, it’s out of my control. Only two things happen to writers when they die: Either their work survives, or it becomes forgotten. Someone will turn up an old box and say, “Who’s this guy Irving Wallace?” There’s no rhyme or reason to it. Ask kids in high school, “Who is Somerset Maugham?” They’re not going to know. He wrote books that were bestsellers in their time. But he’s well-forgotten now, whereas Agatha Christie has never been more popular. She just goes from one generation to another. She’s not as good a writer as Maugham, and she certainly didn’t try to do anything other than entertain people. So I don’t know what will happen. </p>
<p> You’ve threatened to retire a few times, but you’ve obviously never gone through with it. Do you see yourself doing this into your eighties and maybe even beyond? Yeah. What else am I going to do? I mean, shit, you’ve got to do something to fill up your day. And I can only play so much guitar and watch so many TV shows. It fulfills me. There are two things about it I like: It makes me happy, and it makes other people happy. </p>

<p> With over 60 titles to his credit, Stephen King is one of the world’s most prolific authors—and he has been terrifying and captivating us with his prose for nearly half a century. The scariest part? He seems to get better at it as the years go by. What many King newcomers are surprised to find, however, is that he’s no one-trick pony—King’s writing can and does detour from his familiar grisly stomping grounds. It can be said that his true subject matter is the darker side of human nature. However, he provides a strong counterweight to the darkness by showing us the humor, levity, and innocence in even the most dastardly of his characters. In addition, King’s career has been, in many ways, a love letter to his home state of Maine—you can’t get through a King novel without wanting to visit. In this way, King’s books transcend genre and appeal to all lovers of the written word. So forget what you’ve seen in the movies—whether you’re new to Stephen King’s oeuvre, or you’re working on indoctrinating a friend, reading the following 10 books is nonnegotiable. (If you’re looking for a more complete list, check out our ranking of every single one of Stephen King’s novels to date—49 of them so far!) </p>
<p> 10. Carrie King’s first published work is the story of a shy, good-natured teenager who wants what all high school kids want: to have friends and to be “normal.” Not that Carrie has any idea what normal really is, since she has spent the whole of her young life being harangued by her abusive religious zealot of a mother, and tormented by the cruel kids at school. The thing is, Carrie isn’t, strictly speaking, “normal.” She has a supernatural gift those who mistreat her could only dream about. She will have to choose whether to call on this power when the going gets tough. </p>
<p> 9. The Shining Did we say forget what you’ve seen in the movies? Because nowhere in King’s work is that sentiment more necessary than with respect to The Shining. Yes, we all love Jack Nicholson, and yes, the movie was great. It was just a very, very different story from the book. Jack Torrance jumps at the opportunity to become the caretaker for the majestic yet unsettling Overlook Hotel, with wife Wendy and son Danny along for the ride. Things get darker and more horrifying from there, with the hotel coming to vivid life around the family, and turning what was supposed to be a respite from the outside world into a terrorizing intrapsychic nightmare. In addition to much stronger, more well-rounded characters, get ready for lots of hotel fixtures you won’t recall from the movie, including the world’s scariest shrubbery and a boiler room that will make you fear your basement for life. As a bonus, check out recently released sequel Doctor Sleep. </p>
<p> 8. Pet Sematary One word sums up this King favorite: underrated. The novel is classic King—it starts with a happy family in a small town. All is well, until a heavy dose of tragedy and a generous sprinkling of the paranormal rip this story right off the rails. This book is best known for its scary subject matter (King was way ahead of the curve on the whole “creepy kids” trend Hollywood became very fond of a few years later). However, it’s the depth of the familial bond and all the love and grief that comes along with it that truly make this story one to remember. </p>
<p> 7. The Dead Zone If you’re looking for that quintessential King novel that will ensure you spend many evening hours glued to its pages when you should be sleeping, this is it. Johnny Smith is a teacher who has fallen into a coma after a tragic accident. Upon waking, he is shocked to learn that he has psychic abilities. As time passes, Johnny struggles to navigate the world with his new gifts, and is faced with a stomach-turning choice about whether to do the wrong thing for the right reasons. This is one of King’s most masterfully paced books, and it will keep you riveted until the final curtain falls. </p>
<p> {{EAN5}}6. It Don’t understand why some people are terrified of clowns? After you read It, you will. It’s 1958 in Derry, Maine, and seven teenagers are bonded forever when they come together to combat a mysterious and heart-stoppingly evil force. Despite their best efforts to put the past behind them, they’re once again summoned to protect their town when, 30 years later, the evil stirs again. This book is one of King’s most frightening, without a doubt—and it’s the love King instills in us for the characters and the community that truly makes us fear for and root for them with all our hearts. </p>
<p> 5. Misery For all those who think King’s stories have to rely on the supernatural to raise the hairs on readers’ necks, Misery is one notable exception. There are no aliens, evil spirits, or Native American burial grounds in sight. The story begins when a celebrated but jaded author loses control of his car on his way through a treacherous mountain pass. Alone and unconscious, our hero seems all but lost when, miraculously, a local good Samaritan happens by and comes to his rescue. Imagine his relief when he awakens and discovers his savior is not only a trained nurse, but his number one fan. What follows is a chilling treatise on obsession, celebrity culture, and the fathomless depths of the human will to survive. </p>
<p> 4. Salem’s Lot After he debuted with Carrie, many wondered if King would be able to match that novel’s success a second time. Salem’s Lot proved King was more than a literary flash in the pan. Set once again in his beloved Maine, the tale blends King’s customary love for small-town life with a classic horror theme: vampires. When a schoolteacher and his girlfriend fight back against a town full of bloodsuckers, it’s anyone’s guess who will come out on top. Be warned: sleeping with the lights on and a garlic necklace may or may not make you feel any safer after reading this book. </p>
<p> 3. The Green Mile The Green Mile is one of the greatest triumphs of King’s career. Originally released in six installments, the story took the publishing world by storm when all six concurrently ended up on the New York Times bestseller list—and with good reason. John Coffey is a black man in the wrong place at the wrong time. The place is the general vicinity of a murder of two little white girls, and the place is rural 1930s Louisiana. Given those circumstances, it doesn’t take long for John to be sentenced to death via “Old Sparky,” the electric chair waiting at the end of the long green-tiled prison hallway, or the Green Mile. As he waits to be executed, John touches many lives—but can he do enough good to earn his own redemption? With this novel, King turns his unflinching gaze on the racism that permeates America’s history, and brings it hurtling into the reader’s present with supernatural force. </p>
<p> 2. 11/22/63 Speaking of American history, few events have had more impact on American culture than the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. In this novel, King envisions a world where an average guy could go back in time and stop that horrific tragedy. One part historical fiction, one part mystery, and one part action novel, 11/22/63 could only have been written by a gifted author who witnessed and mourned the death of JFK alongside the rest of the nation. In true King fashion, healthy doses of wit, romance, and laughter keep the story vital and fresh until the very end. </p>
<p> 1. The Stand The Stand is widely hailed as King’s crowning achievement. When a subject breaks out of a secure biological testing facility, he exposes humankind to a deadly strain of flu that will wipe out 99 percent of the population in a matter of mere weeks. With the impending apocalypse looming large, those who strive for survival are desperate for a leader. Two would-be leaders emerge, but it will be up to the people to decide which of them to follow. What unfolds is an epic battle: a last stand between good and evil that readers will never forget. </p>
