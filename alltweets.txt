I wish anyone other than Donald Trump--left, right, or center--were taking the Oath of Office tomorrow. My preference would be Barack Obama.

Um, I'm getting something, too. Which is nice, but I'm really anxious to meet those courageous young people.

Trump's tweets in his first hundred days draw a pretty clear portrait: he's an almost textbook case of narcissistic personality disorder.

One remarkable difference between Obama and Trump: the latter seems to have absolutely no sense of humor. The clearest sign of a dull mind.

Trump needs to go.
He's one bad hombre.

Heat up your spring reading with Joe Hill's THE FIREMAN. It will spark your interest and charbroil your nerves.

Trump promises to veto single payer health care, should it get to his desk. No surprise. His rich friends wouldn't like that at all.

Trump calls Rex Tillerson ‚Äúdumb as a rock.‚Äù This seems possible, because it takes one to know one.

Trump is said to be ‚Äúmonitoring the situation‚Äù in Santa Clarita. Is he a useless piece of shit or is it just me?

What scares me? Live TV! Nevertheless, I must go on GOOD MORNING AMERICA tomorrow and flog my book.
